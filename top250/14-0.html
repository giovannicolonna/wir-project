This is a medium or possibly less thick stout. I guess my expectations were primed for the breakfast level of stout. I taste the stout, the bourbon, some roast, a tad coffee. It's a nice stout to drink with some different flavouring.With great appreciation to Putnam for allowing me to buy the last bottle in the store, hidden away for someone like me.<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">444 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/sammy.3853/">Sammy</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/1199/19960/?ba=Sammy">Jul 02, 2006</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="439438" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/uclabrewn84.439438/"><img alt="Photo of UCLABrewN84" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/439/439438.jpg?1329931850" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.74</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#006600;">+3.9%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5</span><br/><br/>HUGE thanks to GrandCruDrew for sending me this one!<br/><br/>Pours a super thick pitch black color with a tiny 1/2 inch dark chocolate colored head that fades to a film on the top of the beer. Wow, this beer smells absolutely fantastic. Chocolate chip cookie dough, sweetened coffee, cinnamon, with a whiff of the oak bourbon barrels. Taste is extremely rich and decadent. Cocoa powder, cookie dough, sweetened coffee with creamer, cinnamon, vanilla, coconut, with the woody bourbon taste coming through on the finish. Mouthfeel is very thick and creamy on this one. Mild alcohol burn in the throat after each sip. I have been wanting to try this one for a long, long time and the hype and all the good things I have heard and read about this beer are all warranted. This is an exceptional beer and it's no wonder this one is super hard to find.<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">838 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/uclabrewn84.439438/">UCLABrewN84</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/1199/19960/?ba=UCLABrewN84">Apr 21, 2011</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="571365" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/kylehay2004.571365/"><img alt="Photo of kylehay2004" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/571/571365.jpg?1375574294" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.64</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#006600;">+1.8%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75</span><br/><br/>Rare opportunity for me in the southeast to have this one. I had about a shot glass if it once before. <br/><br/>A: thin off white head with excellent lacing on a jet black body. A little more head and it would be perfect. May be pour related and do to the fact it is on draft<br/><br/>S: aroma is dominated by milk and dark chocolate and oak with vanilla, bourbon and dark fruit notes. I was sitting under a fan and yet the the aroma stayed full on the nose. <br/><br/>T: I had this one cold then let it warm up to are how it changes. The bourbon dominated when cold. As it warmed I got more chocolate, oak and vanilla. I must say I want more coffee which was more in the after taste. Last years seemed to have more coffee. <br/><br/>M: thick body but doesn't overly coat the palate, smooth with moderate carbonation. Carbonated a bit more than I wanted for the style to make it perfect but damn close.<br/><br/>Overall: I have tried many great beers and this one is at the top of that list. Best thing about it honestly is that it lives up to the hype which for a beer this highly rated is difficult to do. My biggest knock was not enough coffee to balance the sweetness.

I am most blown away how I taste no alcohol at all in this beer. the founders imperial is hotly alcoholic, in this beer, its totally hidden, even though its stronger. some bourbon hints with char and vanilla come through, but this beer isn't sweet at all. not teeth coating, not heavy. its remarkable how drinkable it really is. the coffee feature is as good as it gets, almost weirdly refreshing, like an iced coffee. the depth and complexity of this fine ale is second to none, and the perfection of its craftsmanship is mind boggling. I cant remember a beer so highly hyped that delivers as well as this gem does, save pliny the younger. its that good. thanks again to drlovemd87, youre a bloody legend mate!<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">1,272 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/stonedtrippin.601042/">StonedTrippin</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/1199/19960/?ba=StonedTrippin">May 11, 2013</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="243272" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/thorpe429.243272/"><img alt="Photo of Thorpe429" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/243/243272.jpg?1330444250" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.47</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#990000;">-2%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5</span><br/><br/>G: Oversized snifter.<br/><br/>A: Pours very, very dark and thick with a single-finger caramel-colored head, which has plenty of carbonation and air bubbles.

The sale price wasn't too bad for this beer surprisingly enough.<br/><br/>The beer itself pours out as a really nice black stout. The head does vanish pretty quickly. The aromas of coffee come first than the bourbon and vanilla come trough later. The taste is powerful. It's got to be sipped over a set period of time, don't waste this and drink it fast. Sit back and enjoy it. I also felt that this beer was a little thinner than I expected which was a bit of a bummer. I have one bottle of this left and I'm gonna age it for just a bit before I crack it open. Just want to see if anything changes in it.<br/><br/>Just opened a bottle of this that I bought in June 2010 and split it with a friend. I found this to be even better now after some time has passed. The smell and taste of the beer is much better overall I think.

In many ways, the complexity of roast, espresso, malted milk, and cocoa-rich chocolates is overwhelming, but in others it's beautiful in its simplicity.<br/><br/>The beer opens with a creamy and viscous pour. A mousse-like head forms on at the top of the glass as the opaque black beer settles and cascades while the foam rises. The head reliquishes some over the 11.2% abv. Only nitro-infused beers look better.<br/><br/>Extremely bold aromas of espresso, cocoa beans, and roasted barley take hold of the nose. But their intensity is unmistakable. Strong alcohol scent rises as the beer warms and stimulates the olfactory senses. Simple yet pure.<br/><br/>Flavors take over where the aroma ends. Extreme flavors of espresso, cocoa, and roasted barley set the tone. Malt sweetness takes a far backseat while fully attenuated malt flavor gives just enough of a foundation to support the robust complementary flavors. A subtle grassy, piney hop flavor begins to rise after I become acclimated to the cocoa-coffee attack. Esters and phenolic spice are also left behind, not to muddle the pure Stout flavors. Again, the alcohol flavors are evident and gives a bit more complexity to the taste.<br/><br/>The mouthfeel is stupid-crazy. Creamy, rich, and round while also smooth, velvety, and somewhat powdery. Bitterness arrives from a lot of angles: hops, espersso, cocoa, and alcohol. Never cloying, the beer has attenuated extremely well for a malty-rich texture and no residual sweetness left to the mouth.<br/><br/>Interestingly, this whole review has gone without the mention of the bourbon barrel aging. The barrels have taken the rough edges off of the base beer, as oak aging usually does, but the direct bourbon influence is not that apparent. The added alcohol adds a hint of cherry flavored alcohol (maybe a bit of cough syrup) and only a hint of boozy bourbons. Too light on the caramels, vanillans, and simple oak flavor to mention above the intensity of coffee and cocoa.<br/><br/>The beer is complex in its sheer proportions of relatively few dominant flavors, yet simple in its intent. Coffee- Cocoa- Malt- Hops. And it succeeds at every faucet. It has earned its way onto the worlds greatest beers and rightfully so.<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">2,264 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/beerchitect.14442/">BEERchitect</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/1199/19960/?ba=BEERchitect">May 05, 2006</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="2335" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/phyl21ca.2335/"><img alt="Photo of Phyl21ca" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/2/2335.jpg?1330368410" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.25</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#990000;">-6.8%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4</span><br/><br/>Bottle courtesy from CBA and Moejuck: Poured a deep black color stout with a small foamy head with limited retention but some lacing. Aroma of coffee and vanilla is well balance and even more so then the regular version. Taste was a nice and well balance mix between some coffee, vanilla and light bourbon. The alcohol was hidden and didnt overpower the beer, coffee was well balance as oppose to the regular version and body was oily with a full texture.

Mocha tinged foam sticks around for a minute, then retreats to the edges. Served around 50-55º, don't drink this straight from the fridge, it will mute some of the smell and taste. <br/><br/>Special aroma of dense fudgy chocolate, and woody vanilla traces from the barrel. A little bit of ashy char is there too, though not over the top. Flavors deliver on what the nose hints at, rich chocolate, minor coffee undertone, vanilla, oak, and trace heat from the 10%. Over time it really develops and builds, a long finish connects between each flavor-packed sip. Some light bitterness that is identical to unsweetened chocolate is there, and lingers in the finish. <br/><br/>Incredibly smooth (oats?), not heavy or syrupy, yet it's a sipper. Perfect to sit and contemplate without weighing you down. There's a reason it's ranked so high...it's a very balanced imperial stout, possibly the most balanced i've ever had.<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">1,043 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/emerge077.17949/">emerge077</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/1199/19960/?ba=emerge077">Feb 12, 2008</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="3819" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/buckeyenation.3819/"><img alt="Photo of BuckeyeNation" border="0" height="48" src="styles/default/xenforo/avatars/avatar_male_s.png" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.63</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#006600;">+1.5%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5</span><br/><br/>Complete... utter... total... Stygian black. Despite a big blast of July sunshine behind the glass, there's no hint of lightening at the edges. I think I said the same about Founders Imperial Stout, but I don't know that I've ever seen a darker dollop of foam. The head is 'coffee with a small splash of cream' brown and is incredibly thick and rich. There's even a huge amount of lace for such a high-ABV ale. <br/><br/>Every ingredient that's said to be present is easily noted in the nose. I'm a little disappointed that coffee is in the foreground and bourbon is in the background. I wanted 'Kentucky' to be emphasized more than 'Breakfast'. That said, this is still an incredible aroma. It smells like a prodigious amount of roasted and black malt has been used, complemented nicely by espresso, vanilla and bourbon whiskey.<br/><br/>Founders Kentucky Breakfast Stout is delicous beer. My first few mouthfuls tell me that it doesn't live up to my (probably unrealistic) expectations, but that's the last time in this review that I'll be anything other than positive. I know one thing, I'll buy every bottle that I can get my hands on each and every year.<br/><br/>The flavor profile consists of a monolithic maltiness that is Stonehenge-like in size. Think dark chocolate fudge cake flecked with pulverized coffee beans and swimming in dark caramel and molasses sauce. Of the accessory flavors, vanilla is the most prominent, followed by a burnt sugar, bourbon barrel character that, again, should be more up front. As a bourbon whiskey lover, I wish my favorite liquor saturated every sip.<br/><br/>The most amazing thing about KBS is how completely the alcohol is buried. Other than the beginnings of tongue numbing as I reach the halfway point of the bottle, I have a hard time picking it out. Maybe that because it tastes like bourbon rather than like ethanol. In any case, there's no need to age this beer since there's no alcoholic heat whatsoever. Of course, I'm drinking it almost four months after its release.<br/><br/>I'm tempted to bump the flavor score as the beer warms, but can't quite do it. For all the reasons stated above, I can imagine a better KBS, so this one will have to settle for a less than perfect flavor score. The mouthfeel is luxurious. It's medium-full with a heavy silkiness that promotes gulping rather than sipping. I could get into trouble in a big hurry with this beer.<br/><br/>I don't believe there's a brewery in existence that can match Founders when it comes to big stouts. Breakfast Stout, Imperial Stout, and now Kentucky Breakfast Stout are three of the most incredible beers that I've ever had the pleasure to drink. Never has twelve ounces seemed so much like six. Good thing I have three more bottles to go.<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">2,712 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/buckeyenation.3819/">BuckeyeNation</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/1199/19960/?ba=BuckeyeNation">Jul 11, 2007</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="63854" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/zeff80.63854/"><img alt="Photo of zeff80" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/63/63854.jpg?1405301675" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.45</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#990000;">-2.4%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5</span><br/><br/>2010 version into a goblet<br/><br/>A - Poured out an opaque, jet black color with a one finger, bubbly, caramel-colored head of foam.

The fabled and much adorned Kentucky Breakfast Stout. I was finally able to get my hands on this one, and did not waste anytime in getting my review up here. This was one mean beer, I have to say. This one hurt me, mostly because I did not know it was. Poured a very deep dark black, thick like a shake and a full two finger head of caramel brown foam at the top. Nice gradual settle down left behind some very nice side glass lace. The smell was wonderful, full of sweet caramel and lactose sugar with a rich coffee and chocolate undertone, simply to die for as for as RISs go. The taste was so complex and diverse, I did not know what I was trying, this one was nuts to say the least. Full on assault of sweet caramel and chocolate from the very start, as this mellowed some very nice coffee tones. Very full, rich, and robust profile. This was one not to take lightly. The feel was like a dessert shake. Such a warming feeling, with really no hint of alcohol at all. Overall I would have to say this definitely lived up to its hype. It was a fantastic offering and easily one of the best RIS I have ever had. It fully deserves its reputation and its rating on here. A truly top notch beer that everyone should have to try at least once, definitely and whole hearted recommendation from the BA.<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">1,328 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/mikesgroove.104485/">mikesgroove</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/1199/19960/?ba=mikesgroove">Nov 07, 2007</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="222552" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/womencantsail.222552/"><img alt="Photo of womencantsail" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/222/222552.jpg?1362965777" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.7</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#006600;">+3.1%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5</span><br/><br/>Review #200 comes courtesy of imperialking. Jeff was kind enough to hook it up with two bottles of KBS...as extras!<br/><br/>A: KBS has that wonderful motor oil like pour with a thin layer of mocha colored foam.<br/><br/>S: While I'm not much of a coffee fan, the coffee aroma in this beer is amazing. There are also great chocolate, roasted malt, and ever so slight bourbon scents.<br/><br/>T: Talk about flavor! There are huge coffee, chocolate, roasted malt, and bourbon flavors in this. The alcohol is definitely there, but it's not quite as boozy as I was preparing for.<br/><br/>M: This is a great thick, chewy, creamy beer.<br/><br/>D: The drinkability is surprisingly good for such a strong beer. The beer is not "hot", and the flavors are absolutely sensational.

A slight bit of sudsily-ringed lacing is left behind. The nose has a seemingly unhealthy amount of wood in it, almost as much as a small forest. There's also some bourbon, maple syrup, molasses, dark roast coffee, and charcoal smoke, making this one of the darkest-smelling brews I have ever had. That said, the coffee, wood, and bourbon o'erwhelm the other notes a bit, leaving me an iota unfulfilled. The taste marks a second manifestation of the nose: heavy wood notes, bourbon, molasses, vanilla, smoke, nutmeg, dark roast coffee, toffee, and a hint of chunky peanut butter. This is a fair improvement on the nose, and leaves very little to be desired. The body is indeed pretty hefty, but not too much so. The low carbonation, thick chewiness, and spitefully smooth feel all lead to a high drinkability, though this brew is clearly not a gulper; rather a highly enjoyable deep-sipper. Definitely lives up to the hype!<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">1,146 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/tmoney2591.322390/">TMoney2591</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/1199/19960/?ba=TMoney2591">Mar 17, 2010</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="526" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/nerofiddled.526/"><img alt="Photo of NeroFiddled" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/0/526.jpg?1333917126" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">3.97</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#990000;">-12.9%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4</span><br/><br/>Put on the spot to order a beer quickly, a quick gander at the cooler revealed a beer I'd never had before with a label that read KBS. OK, I'll have that. DOH!!! Once delivered to me I realized that it was Kentucky Breakfast Stout from Founder's. I'd had it before, but the label was different. So, OK, I was having brunch and coffee and bourbon and stout seemed appropriate, and this is a beer that can stand up to (actually dominate over) a spicy mushroom enchilada. What I was not prepared for was the price... $12!!! Damn, if only I'd known.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm sure there are a million reviews for this out there, so I'll keep it simple. I prefer the Breakfast Stout. I think that the Bourbon just adds a bit too much to the mix, and it clearly increases the perception of alcohol, whether there's more there or not. It also cuts down on the really nice coffee flavor that the standard Breakfast Stout has, and I think, the malt flavors as well.<br/><br/>What's nice about the Breakfast Stout is that it's really complex, but that's kind of lost in the KBS because the Bourbon characteristic cuts through a lot of it (at least at the end of the glass).<br/><br/>So although this is not a beer I'd throw out of bed (you know what I mean), it's just not quite as good as the beer that spawned it.<br/><br/>Oh, and I kind of have to ding it for points on the appearance as the head drops immediately, and it leaves little lacing.<br/><br/>Cheers!<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">1,409 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/nerofiddled.526/">NeroFiddled</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/1199/19960/?ba=NeroFiddled">Apr 20, 2009</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="113426" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/kegatron.113426/"><img alt="Photo of Kegatron" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/113/113426.jpg?1330278991" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.5</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#990000;">-1.3%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5</span><br/><br/>On tap @ Founders (Grand Rapids, MI) on 4/22/10. 8 oz of the 2010 edition served in a snifter.<br/><br/>Pours black as midnight in the glass, with a thin covering of reddish &amp; burnt looking mocha colored head. Swirling elicits a huge creamy flare-up that drenches the sides with thick swathes of lace and dark goo. I'm surprised by just how much of the Breakfast Stout is coming through upon first whiff. Roasted coffee and chocolate form a decadent smelling pillar in the nose, which the bourbon and vanilla notes rises up and wrap themselves around. Woody tannins and a touch of floral character lend this a certain degree of gentleness in the nose despite this being such a powerful bouquet. <br/><br/>The taste is very rich up front with crunchy coffee chocolate roast before bourbon and vanilla character just absolutely DRENCHES the back of the throat with warm sweetness. The bourbon does have some sharpness to it but never does quite get stinging (although it is close). It definitely does spread a boozy feel across the palate and in the chest. The tannic notes from the oak has a touch of raw and green feel to it, with the bourbon and wood leaving a lot of deep dryness in it's wake. The mouthfeel is full bodied and rich, with a big creamy feel that fills the mouth up with flavor. I'm getting some of that 11% ABV but most of the alcohol appears to come from the bourbon and stays out of the body for the most part, helping keep this a very steady sipper.<br/><br/>It's hard for me to say if I like this beer fresher, with the coffee and vanilla popping, or if I like it more with some age and all of that bourbon and wood showing itself a little stronger. Makes me wish that I had tried a glass of the 2009 next to it. Always the tough decisions to make on these ridiculous pre-DLD trips to Founders in the wake of the Black Party the weekend before...<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">1,843 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/kegatron.113426/">Kegatron</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/1199/19960/?ba=Kegatron">May 03, 2010</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="163147" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/jlindros.163147/"><img alt="Photo of jlindros" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/163/163147.jpg?1330109375" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.85</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#006600;">+6.4%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5</span><br/><br/>Acquired this beauty thanks to BEERchitect. I've been dreaming of cracking this open for weeks. I've woken up in a cold sweat a few times dreaming of dancing Founders bottles with KBS letters flying out at me and into my mouth, and rivers of dark tasty liquid showering me in droves of awesomeness. And now its finally time to sample this thing. I feel like that virgin 17year old at prom that finally steps into the hotel room with his date, made of beer.<br/><br/>A: AS it pours it leaves a dark stain on the air. As it rims around the glass it also leaves a dark brown syrup on the sides, it so thick I can't even call it a stain. I can only match the thickness of this to 40W oil after it came out of a 200k mile car and was there almost all 200k miles. I can almost see chunks of grains floating out with it, but I think that's my brain on KBS. A very faint almost detectable head starts to appear, but it's just a tease as it fades from memory and leaves a few small cliques of bubbles <br/><br/>N: Despite being able to smell the roasted malts and chocolate from the stains on the air, I decided to go in deeper. I think I need someone to cover me. The nose is so overwhelming I think my insides just stained a dark coffee brown color. Tons of coffee and roasted malts just come billowing out of the glass on a horse of dark bakers chocolate. It does remind me a lot of regular breakfast stout at this point, but then comes the awesomeness of the bourbon and oak. The remnants of the bourbon and alcohol dance their way into my nostrils burning the edges slightly as my nose both cringes and begs for more like a sadomasochistic kid getting his first taste of the whip. Did I mention there was some coffee and chocolate there?<br/><br/>T: Oooohhhh snap! Here comes the train. The molasses thick oil like liquid slowly spreads out over my tongue. Lots of sweetness and chocolate come spreading out. The coffee instantly wakes my ass up, hence breakfast. The alcohol taste and burn really just lashes out at my mouth with hot pokers almost as if my mouth has just died and gone to hell. The bourbon taste starts to come through once the heavy set chocolate and coffee attempt to die out. And by attempt to die out I mean when your mouth starts to become used to it because this stuff never goes away. More dark sweetness that could only have come from the depths of Candyland hell start to berate my taste buds for attempting a second sip. It leaves a thick coating all around the mouth as if it was secretly made of wax that sticks when warm. It also seems to leave a slightly milky residue bringing me back to 5th grade and dousing my milk with so much chocolate I used to just take the Hersheys plastic container and fill IT with milk rather than the other way around. Some quick oats dash their way into the taste enough to make a horse blush. A touch of oak and vanilla round it off, if you can say that.<br/><br/>M: Really? Have you not figured out by now? Super thick and sticky, a viscosity of some huge number. The alcohol burns the edges of the mouth and any flesh that dares stand in it's way. Could use a slight bit of more carbonation, but that is most likely a product of the aging.<br/><br/>F: Finishes semi sweet, like just chewing on a piece of rubber coffee cake and then biting on some baker's chocolate. The thickness fills all the pours and taste buds so much so that I don't think I'll be able to taste my dinner tomorrow. The coffee's caffeine can't be absorbed anymore as everything is coated with that huge thick substance, more solid than liquid. The slight oak and vanilla, followed by bourbon and more alcohol seem to fade last on the tongue, except the chocolate and coffee which never disappear. With it being so ridiculously thick and strong tasting I can barely continue to sip it.<br/><br/>Final thoughts: While I'm sitting here enjoying this amazing beverage that I have been having wet dream about, I think my house is on fire, my son is probably in the corner chewing on wires or something, and the Patriots are somehow getting their butts kicked by Buffalo, but none of that matters as my world fades into a vertigo feeling as I blissfully attempt to consume and digest this crazy stuff. It's almost as if I'm living vicariously through myself trying to enjoy this, or am I still dreaming. Perhaps its a coma I slipped into when I took my first sip of it. I don't even think there is a word in the English language to describe it, so I'll make one up. This beer, is it still really a beer at this point, anyways this beer is transcendingerompteous. Need I say more? Can't wait till this stuff comes around again.<br/><br/>Edit: The Patriots came back to win with :50 left in the game, 2 hours later, just as I was finishing up the KBS!<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">4,721 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/jlindros.163147/">jlindros</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/1199/19960/?ba=jlindros">Sep 15, 2009</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="37950" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/themaniacalone.37950/"><img alt="Photo of TheManiacalOne" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/37/37950.jpg?1330218315" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.32</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#990000;">-5.3%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4</span><br/><br/>Acquired from both plaztikjezuz and jpm30 in concurrent trades, so a big Thank You goes out to them.
