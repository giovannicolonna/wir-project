Beer added by: illidurit on 07-13-2009<br/><br/>In Belgian brewing there are fantastic wild ales brewed with naturally occurring yeast. These beers develop over time and are ready on their own terms. Duck Duck Gooze is our homage to these effervescent and wonderfully complex sparkling beers.<br/> <br/>A blend of young and old barrel aged beers, this has been one of our most sought after beers year after year since it’s original release in 2009.<br/> <br/>Alas, it is released in very small quantities only once every three years, so it’s extremely difficult to come by beyond the day we release it. It does, however, turn up on our Tasting Room’s Vintage List from time to time, so don’t despair.<!--/sse--></td>

Sampled on September 15, 2009.<br/><br/>A: Beautiful golden, tawny apricot color with a fairly long-lasting bone-white head. The initial head on a semi-hard pour into my tulip glass was a little over an inch, and it has settled down to a little over a quarter of an inch. Rich effervescent bubbles immediately after the pour settle into a mild vertical flight of carbonation as the brew settles. The lacing clings mildly as I quaff the beer down.<br/><br/>S: A prickly sourness is the most apparent scent upon first sniff. As I bring the glass back for another whiff, I smell sweet Meyer lemons alongside sour green grapes and a few tropical notes. There's also a slight oakiness, which I gather will assert itself further as the beer warms from fridge temperature. As it warms, there is a little more of a slightly funky earthy aroma. <br/><br/>T: As with the nose, there is a mouth-puckering tartness as I take my first sip; it takes my mouth a moment to adjust, and my eyes have gotten a little watery. While I'm certainly no sour expert, I wouldn't recommend this as a beginner's wild ale. As I get further into the glass I can detect a lot more--the lemon is much less pronounced in the taste, and coming further is more of a Granny Smith-type sourness.<br/><br/>M: The tartness is obvious and the first sip made my lips pucker and left my cheeks quite dry; the dryness subsides as my palate becomes more accustomed to the beverage, but the refreshing acidic tartness remains throughout. The carbonation is fairly light, which is very nice and refreshing on what is hopefully one of the last hot days here in Northern Virginia. My biggest complaint is that this is something my taste buds were able to adjust to a little too much, as the last sip wasn't nearly as puckering as the first couple. Also, while not a style that needs plenty of carbonation, this one could use a tad bit more.<br/><br/>D: Drinkability is quite high; as I took my second sip, I was saddened by the fact that I had only another 700 mL or so of this tart, puckering nectar. While this may not have been the kindest year to Lost Abbey, Duck Duck Gooze is certainly making the brightest impression upon me.<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">2,203 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/thorpe429.243272/">Thorpe429</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/18149/51116/?ba=Thorpe429">Sep 15, 2009</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="99624" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/largadeer.99624/"><img alt="Photo of largadeer" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/99/99624.jpg?1330021265" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.35</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#990000;">-3.8%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4</span><br/><br/>Golden with a slight haze. Two fingers of head rises from vigorous pouring and retains fairly well, ultimately settling to a thick disc around the rim of the glass. The nose is complex but balanced, barnyard funk backed by lemon and orange-like acidity, lactic sourness, acetic acid, and a unique tropical fruit sweetness that really makes the beer. Opens on the palate with sharp lactic acidity and well-expressed tannins. Fruit flavors of pineapple, orange and lemon add interesting complexity. Moderate acetic presence mid-palate, woody and lightly astringent, with the malt coming out a bit more, lending a light sweetness that leads into a dry, sharp and tannic finish. The noticeable acetic quality is a slight detraction, but I love the strong tropical fruit character. Another winner for Lost Abbey; they should really concentrate on these barrel-aged sour beers, they're often excellent.<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">896 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/largadeer.99624/">largadeer</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/18149/51116/?ba=largadeer">Sep 04, 2009</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="17949" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/emerge077.17949/"><img alt="Photo of emerge077" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/17/17949.jpg?1381242592" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.65</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#006600;">+2.9%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5</span><br/><br/>Strong pop from the cork, emitting a little wisp of gunsmoke, then laid into a lambic basket to serve it. <br/><br/>Dusty crystalline orange with an ethereal haze of skim across the surface. It was like a web of spindly clouds that ebb and fade on the wind. A thin ring at the edge with some random spotty lace around, the broken skim remained for the whole glass. <br/><br/>Lemon custard, wet hay, citrus aromas, very authentic and Belgian lambic inspired. Woody farmhouse funk that further supports the lambic impression. With a swirl it intensifies with a sharp acid/petrol note. <br/><br/>Dry and tart with lots of unique fruit for a Wild Ale. Lemon and sweet tarts, with an ever so slight edge of sweetness that surfaces at the back. The sour/sweet balance is near perfect, lending to the puckering feel with the salivary glands working overtime. A nice mellow softness enhances the overall feel of it, in contrast to the sharpness of a traditional Gueuze. 7/10 on the sour scale. The finish is dry with some oaky barrel traces in the aftertaste. This is an exercise in self-control not to just gulp the whole bottle down. One of the most drinkable Wild Ale examples out there. Though incredible, i'd still give the slight edge to Isabelle. Would love to taste some Phunky Duck, as this blend is very tasty.<br/><br/>Huge thanks to Weibull for his overflowing generosity, never thought i'd get to try this! Thanks also to Masterski for the preview sample!<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">1,428 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/emerge077.17949/">emerge077</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/18149/51116/?ba=emerge077">Sep 19, 2009</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="104485" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/mikesgroove.104485/"><img alt="Photo of mikesgroove" border="0" height="48" src="styles/default/xenforo/avatars/avatar_s.png" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.97</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#006600;">+10%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5</span><br/><br/>So damn happy to be able to get a hold of this one. Big thanks to Stonepurist for sending this one out to me. Chilled down to 50 degrees and the 750ml bottle was popped and decanted into my darkness snifter. Consumed on 08/06/2009.<br/><br/>Appearance 4.5 - Poured out a very hazy golden yellow color. A little white head on top, maybe a quarter of an inch but it stayed on top for damn near the entire session, really looked quite nice I have to admit. Light rings of lace on the side of the glass and a really nice and very bright color to it.<br/><br/>Smell 5 - Beautiful. Like a funky masterpiece. Loads of tart apple notes, hints of sour grapes, lots of fruit all over the place. Bright, with a touch of light citrus notes bouncing around as well. Very well put together I have to admit. Really am like where this one is going. As I let it warm it opens up even more. So bright and complex, yet simple. Sour at its perfection.<br/><br/>Taste 5 - Ok. So I am anticipating something huge here. To be honest I have followed this beers progress for a while, drooling at the early reviews and statements of it. I am comparing it to Isabelle, again another sublime beer. I take the first sip, the only thoughts that cross my mind bring me back to being a long lad growing up in Jersey. Running through the orchards and picking fresh granny smith apples. You take that first bite into the green fruit on that crisp fall day and all bets are off. Huge tart and sour notes just pucker your lips and leave you in amazement of the flavor you are experiencing. It was like that times ten. I was floored. Clean, crisp, super funky and tart, I was beyond impressed here. One of the best tasting beers, let alone sour beers that I have ever come across. It was really that damn good. Say what you will, but wow. Nice long drawn out close to it really lets that flavors absorb on the palate and that taste, which wonderful sour taste just will not fade and hangs in your mouth forever. Not much else I can say, but wow.<br/><br/>Feel 5 - Perfect. Carbonation is spot on. Light and airy. Flavors are accented wonderful by the feel. This is what dreams are made of people.<br/><br/>Drinkability - Incredible, I could have drank this one all day. Unbelievably crisp. That taste was mind-blowing, carbonation perfect. Light balanced and sublime. I was so utterly sad to see the last drop leave my glass that it depressed me the rest of the night.(not really I had another bottle)<br/><br/>Overall - Wow, just wow. I had been worried with all the heat that Lost Abbey has taken recently as to whether or not this one would stand up. And boy did it ever. One of the best sours I have ever had, hands down. Up there with Isabelle and Beatification, this thing is a beast. This must be sought out, it lives up to the hype and actually surpassed it for me.<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">2,788 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/mikesgroove.104485/">mikesgroove</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/18149/51116/?ba=mikesgroove">Aug 08, 2009</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="222552" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/womencantsail.222552/"><img alt="Photo of womencantsail" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/222/222552.jpg?1362965777" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.55</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#006600;">+0.7%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5</span><br/><br/>A: Hazy, pale yellow in color without much head.<br/><br/>S: Smells as tart as I would have hoped.

Poured from the bottle into a tasting snifter.<br/><br/>Appearance: The beer pours a cloudy golden amber color with not much visible carbonation.<br/><br/>Smell: Tart lemony funk with a touch of malt sweetness. Not nearly as funky as a traditional gueuze.<br/><br/>Taste: I'm not sure I would call this a gueuze. Much sweeter than most gueuzes I've had. Less funky than I would have expected. Tart lemon and some vinegar. The finish is slightly herbal and sour. <br/><br/>Mouthfeel: The body is medium with tingly carbonation and a dry finish.<br/><br/>Overall: I thought this was a very good American Wild, but I was expecting a gueuze (I know it's listed as a wild, but the name made me thin gueuze).

This stays rich looking on the edges, coating the sides of the glass with white froth. The aroma is tart citrus right off the bat, probably being most akin to the smell of grapefruit juice, along with some mustiness and woody oak character. Going deeper reveals some cider-like vinegar notes and more pronounced vanilla and char. I like the fact that the more pleasant fruity tartness sits on top, while the more meat &amp; potatoes character of the souring and tannic presence sit underneath with a much slicker feel. Good stuff here. <br/><br/>The taste is a bit more acidic and vinegar feeling at first, but those same brash citric flavors of lemon, peach, and grapefruit just about keep even pace. Esters and funk permeate the whole profile, along with notes of tannic oak and vanilla. These blend in with some sweeter accents of sugar and honey, which thankfully are constant throughout the taste but not constantly overridden by the tartness, sourness, and funk. Wow, oak and vinegar really just sticks to the roof of the mouth in the finish and it is a bit hard to shake. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a mild softness that sits on top of the tongue but then gives way to a lower carbonated and slick feel that falls right in line with the barrel character and ABV of this. Once I got past the initial shock of the flavors, my palate adapted pretty readily to this, making for a most favorable experience. <br/><br/>This was, all in all, pretty intense at times for me but in the end, I couldn't ignore the beautiful balance between the tartness, sourness, funk, sweetness, and barrel flavors. Just a fantastic Wild Ale blend here. A beer to be proud of for sure.<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">1,870 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/kegatron.113426/">Kegatron</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/18149/51116/?ba=Kegatron">Dec 02, 2009</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="163147" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/jlindros.163147/"><img alt="Photo of jlindros" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/163/163147.jpg?1330109375" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.47</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#990000;">-1.1%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 5</span><br/><br/>Been waiting to crack this bitch for years! Finally got the chance at a big sour/whale tasting. Thanks a ton to JAXSON for providing this beast among beasts.<br/><br/>Pours a very light fizzy head, and knowing the history of this one surprised it has any head at all. Hazy bright golden straw like color.<br/><br/>Nose brings a light tart funk right off, golden very light malts, fruity juice like aromas with lots of tart fruit, a hint of funk and hint of acidity, and a big tartness.<br/><br/>Taste starts quite sour actually, with a huge acidity! Acetic acid comes through with a big funk taste, lacto like funk, with juicy sour fruit, hint citrusy even, with a tart almost berry like fruit. Light bready malts in the background and towards the finish play up the sharp acid bite and nice blend of sour juice and tart fruit. there is a very slight hint of a vanilla oak barrel rounding effect, but that's mostly drowned out by the tart fruits, funk, and big acid kick. Finish is dry, bone dry, with a bit of bready malts, some funk, tart fruit, a little plemmy, and more acetic acid.<br/><br/>Mouth is lighter bodied, with very little carb.<br/><br/>Overall fan-freakin-tastic! Amazing gueuze, with great blend of sour fruit juice, tart almost fresh fruit flavors, some funk, and plenty of acidity and a light typical bready malt finish. Nice and dry, and all in all fairly drinkable surprisingly. Really wish I could have gotten more of this to at least have another one in the cellar. The only real issue is lack of carbonation, and a few year old beer, and being a Lost Abbey beer in the time of Tomme Arthur carbonation issues (if you want to call it that), still pretty good.<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">1,643 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/jlindros.163147/">jlindros</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/18149/51116/?ba=jlindros">Jul 22, 2012</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="102045" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/slatetank.102045/"><img alt="Photo of Slatetank" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/102/102045.jpg?1443628021" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.88</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#006600;">+8%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5</span><br/><br/>I was looking forward to trying this for a while -thanks to Maltzilla for the trade. Poured cooler than cellar temp from the 750ml into a cervoise.<br/><br/> The color is clear golden with thick bone white cap with a very tight formation of beading to make up the head - the clarity is good enough to see carbonation rising steadily and the lace sticks to the glass - the head settles to a ring of about 1/4 inch high. The aroma of fruit emanates from the glass with a very vinous odor -white grape and mild honeydew with a slight hint of golden delicious apple brings out the sweet notes from the malt along with the tart qualities of the wild yeast - some mild wood and light sour fragrance comes forward with mild lemony aspect -but a tropical nose emerges and seems to add more floral and light herbal notes to the nose. The feel is great -exeptional and has a moderately strong sour element with assertive but not bitter quality-mildly dry with citrus juiciness and lots of puckering tinges but not over the top or harsh, a very gentle sweetness cushions the tanginess and sour elements well.<br/><br/> The flavors are citrusy with orange and lemonade puckering taste yet there is a light dry taste w/ mild wood and gentle lactic accents. The taste of the wood gives a dry flavor with light lemony acidity following and subtle oak w/ hints of white grape combine to give a mild astringent edge to the smooth malt and fruit from the yeast- the green grape and hints of bitter citrus blend with the tannic flavor from the wood as it finishes. There is an almost peachy floral and tropical sweetness in the background which is very pleasant and adds to the complexity of the barrel to offset some of the dry elements in the taste. Duck Duck Gooze is as good as I remember from having it at Extreme Beer Fest 2 years ago -it may even be better - the beer has a lot of complexity and wonderful flavors for a 5% wild ale- this was very memorable and well worth the effort to acquire - I wood seek this out again.<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">1,995 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/slatetank.102045/">Slatetank</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/18149/51116/?ba=Slatetank">Feb 15, 2011</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="304205" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/rifugium.304205/"><img alt="Photo of Rifugium" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/304/304205.jpg?1330109976" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.04</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#990000;">-10.6%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4</span><br/><br/>Slightly hazy, golden yellow color, with a bubbly white head that sank to a ringlet, leaving some spots of lacing on the glass; Champagne-like carbonation bubbling from the glass bottom. A lot going on in the nose, mainly funkadelics, earthy, bretty, aromas of horseblanket, lemon zest and apple peel, leaving no doubt that this will have some sourness to it. Very acidic on the palate, almost too much actually, nearly wrecking. After adjusting for a moment or two, out come flavors of acidic citrus and sour stone fruits, lemon drops, lesser notes of earthy funk, horseblanket, distant crackery malts. Dry and crisp mouthfeel, medium body, and--if you conquer that initial blast of palate-wrecking acidity--a pretty easy drinker for the style.

Brought this to our DC Sour Tasting. 2009 vintage.<br/><br/>a - Pours a clear deep golden color with one inch of bright white head and moderate carbonationi evident. Looks amazing.<br/><br/>s - Smells of sour fruits, lemon, citrus, hay, earth, wine, oak, grapes, funk, brett, and apples. Ton of sourness, brett, and some light funk mix to an amazing smell. Near perfect for me.<br/><br/>t - Tastes of sour fruits, light wine, oak, brett, apples, lemon and citrus hops, some earthy notes, and sour grapes. Awesome taste, though the nose is slightly better.<br/><br/>m - Medium body and low to moderate carbonation. Crisp and very easy to drink.<br/><br/>o - Overall I thought this was an amazing wild ale; one of the best at the tasing for me, and one of the best I've ever had. The nose is perfect and just a ton of sourness and funk. Well worth the hype and really hoping the rumors are true that they are making this one again.

Bottle purchased through Sinner's Club in 2009. Served in taster pint during the Half Acre/Pipeworks/de Struise brewday.<br/><br/>A - Hazed dark peach/apricot body with a quick-dissolving finger of white foam that settles to a thick ring, leaving a few splotches of lace.<br/><br/>S - Funky fruits, oak, acetic and lactic acidity, lemons. As it warms a touch more stone fruit, vanilla, and graham crackery malt. Too sweet to truly convince as a gueuze, but it's an excellent American Wild Ale nonetheless.<br/><br/>T - Taste is initially sweeter too, but it actually grows more sour as it warms up. Sharp oak mingles with lemony brett, stone fruits and lactic acidity. As the bottle drains and more yeast and sediment is introduced there is a mild yogurt character.<br/><br/>M - Medium bodied, with medium zesty carbonation, and a super dry and puckering finish. No alcohol is present.<br/><br/>D - A really enjoyable and well-crafted wild ale, but not quite as strong as Isabelle or Cable Car '09. Still - highly recommended and well worth seeking out. I understand that Isabelle would be logistically impossible to recreate, and that Cable Car is solely for Toronado, but there's no good reason why Tomme shouldn't be blending up more of this every year.<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">1,230 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/masterski.113604/">MasterSki</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/18149/51116/?ba=MasterSki">May 05, 2011</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="401018" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/orangesol.401018/"><img alt="Photo of orangesol" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/401/401018.jpg?1405025231" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.43</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#990000;">-2%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5</span><br/><br/>Big thanks to Deuane for bringing this one to our gueuze tasting.

The balance of tartness and sweetness is spot on. Finish is pretty tart, leaving the pallet dried for quite awhile after the finish.<br/><br/>M - Medium body and flavor with moderate carbonation.

This was one of my short list beers for a long time. Never successfully traded for it but somehow was still lucky enough to split it with Matt. Thanks, I'll get you back soon.<br/><br/>Beer served in a tulip, of sorts. Beer is yellow and slightly hazy. Forms a thin broken white head of tiny bubbles that slowly pulls to the edge of the glass but does not leave lacing on the sides. Carbonation is moderate to low and made up of small and medium bubbles that slowly expand as they approach the top of the beer. Looks good. The dregs of the bottle darken the beer significantly and make the beer much cloudier. Not shocking there. The dregs do not noticably affect the aroma, mouthfeel, or flavor of the beer. <br/><br/>Yep, its a sour alright. Aroma is a straight 5 in my opinion. Its really strong. The first whiff I took was a little solventy. Reminded me of isopropanol and toluene. I was crest fallen but kept smelling. The solvency gave way to a strong oakiness, bitterness and lactic / acetic mixture of acids. Mild citric bite to the end. Very pungent, very strong. Very complex.<br/><br/>The lead off flavor is a strong lactic and acidic sourness. No sweetness at all. I was expecting some funk to come along but instead there is almost a collapse of the palate close to the back. No tartness in the corners of the mouth you might expect with other, usually fruit, flavored lambics. The body of the beer is pretty thin, minimal carbonation in the mouth but its there. If you hold the beer there for a moment it begins to burn around the gums and behind the lips. The beer is very sour and minimally bitter. Finishes cleanly, probably due to the lack of back palate tart and funk. A great beer overall and a great sour.

Huge thanks to Jay for opening this one up.<br/><br/>A: Pours a clear, extremely golden color with no head or lacing at all. <br/><br/>S: Nice tartness, very fragrant peach, apricot, and a little bit of lemon. There is a very nice sourness mixed with some light funk and acid, but the fruit is quite nice. <br/><br/>T: Fantastic, lots of lemon and peach with a great mixture of tart/funk/earthy flavors. There is some citrus fruit and a little stone fruit. Very sharp acidity on the back end. Faint oak comes through as well. <br/><br/>M: Medium bodied, extremely smooth with a great level of carbonation. <br/><br/>O: Lives up to its reputation. Great fruit flavor with the level of sourness/acidity that I love in this style.

Poured into stone old guardian snifter.<br/><br/>Pours hardly and head. Color is a nice hazed sunset hued orange straw color. Some sediment in the glass.<br/><br/>Aroma: Lots of horse blanket and funk. A nice amount of fruit: peaches, muskmelon, grapes, and cherries. Very nice aroma. Some oak and citric acid as well.<br/><br/>Taste: A lot like the aroma. Nice and funky. Horse blanket with lots of fruit: peaches, apricots, grapes, and cherries. It starts out sour and tart, but then ends a lot sweeter and clean. The oak and citric acid shows in a good way again.<br/><br/>Mouthfeel: Sour and tart. Lighter to medium bodied with a lower amount of carbonation, but nice for the style. Ends sweet and clean.<br/><br/>Overall, this is one fine beer. Very drinkable. I slowly savored this one to try and make it last longer. Very good. I really enjoyed how it started sour and ended sweet. Glad I got to try this one. Thanks Daniel!<br/><br/>Edit, after having a bottle thanks to kbutler1, I just can't set this beer down. Amazing drinkability *bumped score to a 5.0.<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">1,091 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/mothman.144305/">mothman</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/18149/51116/?ba=mothman">Jan 28, 2010</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="500016" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/shanepb.500016/"><img alt="Photo of ShanePB" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/500/500016.jpg?1438285285" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.23</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#990000;">-6.4%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5</span><br/><br/>On our two year anniversary (well technically two days after, I was sick), my girlfriend and I cracked this open with dinner. Poured into two snifter glasses.<br/><br/>A: A very pretty hazy, golden-orange body with a very small and supple white head. The dissipation was rather rapid though a thin ring stuck around throughout the entirety of evening.<br/><br/>S: Loads of barnyard hay are up-front, giving it a very earthy and grassy funk to it. Lemons, apricot and sweet malt vinegar notes come through mid-way. The end scent is a distinct extremely tart/sour candy aroma - pretty overpowering, nice.<br/><br/>T: The tartness of the beer sends your palate into immediate shock, whoa, I wasn't expecting that much! Really, a very sour beer immediately calmed only by some citrusy zest: orange and lemon, again. The finish is a puckering white grapefruit tartness - this beer screams sour through and through. Wow. Kind of sickeningly sour after a while...<br/><br/>M: Light, effervescent to a "t" and extremely crisp.<br/><br/>Well, it was wonderful to finally be able to sample this iconic beer from The Lost Abbey. I tried going into this blinded but after reading some of the other reviews, my experience seemed to differ - smarties candy? No way. Not enough sweetness or fruitiness, which I expected a lot of. This beer is definitely one to try, worth a World Class rating?

Been wanting to try this one for awhile so thanks again Matt!<br/><br/>From a 750ml corked and caged bottle this brew pours a clear golden yellow color with a pillow of white fizzy head sitting atop. The bubbles are fairly large and the cap is supported by a constant stream of rising carbonation. This is quite an attractive looking offering that displays no haze and spotty lacework clings to the glass.<br/><br/>The smell of this brew is funky suggesting notes of Brett that are introduced in a pleasing way that breaks up a readily apparent indication of fruity lemon zest. The smell of this brew was an exciting surprise of lemon verse the funk I was expecting. There is seemingly no indication of alcohol to be found in this smell. It is well rounded and super enjoyable before I have even taken a sip.<br/><br/>The taste of this brew is quite acidic blended with notes of Brett that impart a lightly cheese-like flavor coupled with an overall funkiness. It is both tart and acidic that give an accent to the light lemon flavor that is included. The Brett is enjoyable, not too subtle that you have to search for it and not overpowering at all. The lemony aspect seemingly clings inside the mouth with nearly an oily lasting power of resines. At times this brew seems to pick up a contrasting sweetness that is revealed as I concentrate more on the lemony flavor. The blend here of flavors is enjoyable and seemingly different with every sip, awesome array of tartness, acidity and funk before the first indications of the bitey alcohol reveals itself once the brew is warm.<br/><br/>This is a medium to light bodied brew with a moderate to high level of carbonation. Very easy drinking and enjoyable with it's tangy acidity and drying quality on the tongue. The alcohol is well integrated into this brew, it just works. Each sip has a big salivation factor to it which urged me to drink more almost carelessly without thinking about the characteristics it was offering. The only thing I can fault this beer for is it's lack of availability. I wish I could drink this on a regular basis.<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">2,136 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/stakem.300923/">stakem</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/18149/51116/?ba=stakem">Mar 02, 2011</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="168653" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/huhzubendah.168653/"><img alt="Photo of Huhzubendah" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/168/168653.jpg?1330063255" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.77</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#006600;">+5.5%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5</span><br/><br/>I shared a bottle of this with drabmuh and our wives last Sunday.<br/><br/>The label art is fantastic and hilarious. The beer appears mostly clear, with just a slight haze. The color is golden yellow, with a small head and just a touch of lacing. <br/><br/>The aroma is sour and funky, but not overly so. Straw and hay scents with a slight barn or farmyard presence. Very enticing.<br/><br/>The beer is so easy to drink. I am very impressed. It tastes incredibly smooth and clean, and all of the complexities are balanced very well. Masterfully done. As we delved deeper into the bottle, the beer gets slightly more sour and funky. Hooray dregs. The finish is tart and funky with a hint of vinegar, but no burning acidity.<br/><br/>An awesome beer and well worth tracking down.<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">745 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/huhzubendah.168653/">Huhzubendah</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/18149/51116/?ba=Huhzubendah">Jul 28, 2010</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="2737" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/gueuzedude.2737/"><img alt="Photo of Gueuzedude" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/2/2737.jpg?1330016179" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.5</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#990000;">-0.4%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5</span><br/><br/>A solid Pour into my 25cl tulip glass produces a frothy, two-finger thick, pale, almost white head. The beer is a murky, pale amber color that shows quite a bit of haze (much is a chill haze as it was clearer at room temps) and a rich gold color when held up to the light. I only let this sit for just under two weeks (I couldn't wait any longer), so this was still a touch hazy even before I chilled it down.<br/><br/>The aroma has a tart lemon like bite to it up front but finishes with a distinct tropical fruit and even more pineapple notes at the backend of the aroma. Musty, damp cellar notes mix with a musky, phenolic soaked moldy cotton, sweat stained well worn leather character are a sure Brettanomyces signature. There is a touch of toastiness here that seems to be contributed by both oak and grain; the latter also produces some saltine cracker notes I can't get away from the fruitiness here, while it is not overwhelming (the lactic contribution is probably the most dominant in this complex nose, but not by much) and even a touch subtle, it is quite distinct from say a Belgian Lambic; tropical fruit, with a touch of green apple at times can be quite distinct at times, though at others it can be quite fleeting too. As the beer warms a sort of unripe, green fruit character seems to get accentuated, some how it reminds me of nopalitos (prickly pear cactus paddles ready for cooking).<br/><br/>My first sip is puckeringly tart, but there seems to be a hint of sweetness to this brew too (though perhaps this is just perceived from a soft acetic character). Subsequent sips lose the shocking sourness but retain a robust, amply tart lactic acid component that dominates the flavor profile. The body is quite full for something that is so dry and I am sure much of it is contributed by tannic oak and the lactic slickness that is found in significantly sour beers. There is a buttery note here that I at first thought might be some residual diacetyl, but I am not convinced it is more likely oak derived; in fact I am pretty sure of this. Despite being quite sour, there is still a lot more going on here; spicy oak notes, a solid virgin oak stave woodiness, a touch of urea, maybe a hint of an acetic bite (actually as this warms I think this becomes more apparent, though it is nothing more than a background note), maybe a touch of green apple, . There is a touch of astringency and sharpness to the finish that seems to leach into the oral-nasal cavity and the roof of my mouth after a sip as passed down my throat.<br/><br/>My second pour of this beer is, unsurprisingly, a touch more hazy. Underneath the ever present acidity there is a soft Brettanomyces influenced funk; layers of mustiness, definite phenolic notes that don't quite reach curing plastic levels as well as a hint of musky, sweat dried, abused blankets that become a touch more apparent towards the finish. <br/><br/>I could drink a lot of this beer. The aroma is nicely complex and though the flavor could be a little bit more so, it is still a fine tipple overall. This substitutes very nicely for a traditional Belgian-sourced Lambic and I so wish I had a bunch of bottles of this. For those who like a more integrated faux Lambic, this beer will be enjoyed a bit more than the fresh Isabelle Proximus. Comparing these fresh though, I liked the additional complexity of the Isabelle Proximus (funkiness and oak were more prominent in the first beer released). This is still quite a fine beer though and it serves as proof that the funky beers at Lost Abbey are still strong and full of life.<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">3,553 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/gueuzedude.2737/">Gueuzedude</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/18149/51116/?ba=Gueuzedude">Aug 25, 2009</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="181122" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/barflyb.181122/"><img alt="Photo of BARFLYB" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/181/181122.jpg?1346474139" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.62</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#006600;">+2.2%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5</span><br/><br/>Served On-Tap at Monk's Cafe for Philly Beer Week. I love this city! Thanks Tomme and Tom.<br/><br/>Coming at me with a hazy yellowish blond look with hints of orange poking around in there. Looks a bit lighter than medium in build and there is no head at all from the tap, no lacing. Smells include big musk of barn with horse and hay. A big basket of lemons and assorted fruits. Oak, wood and some musty aroma with a dousing of brett, maybe lacto? Smells like it's going to be sour. And it is, a nice sour gueuze. I had this out of the bottle young and can tell it's only growing in funk. Taste is tart lemon drops with apricot and small pineapple blast. Warming brings a bit of apple to the stage. In the middle a earthy taste with oak tannins but not any vanilla which is ok by me. The sourness is pleasant and a bit acidic, but not quite there yet. There is actually a nice faint sweetness going along with the sour in that order. Puckering, yes, overly puckering, no. Quite balanced. Medium bodied and nicely carbed. Crisp and semi dry I 'll take another please. Id like to see where this goes in a year or two but the chances of getting another bottle are slim.
