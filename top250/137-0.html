I have had chocolate and either raspberry or strawberry filling..in fruit wine and liquors naturally or more than naturally sweet. That's dessert. Yes in this beer there is distinct flavours from the eisbock, the chocolate, the tart raspberry. Yes, very much like an American filled chocolate. To me, this is a fruit beer. I have had good beers with chocolate. I have had Unibroue and other fruit beers. This one had the memory of tart raspberry on my palate hours later. Thanks Jay.<br/>Had an unusual low carbonation at the brewery 6 months later.

I get so much organic fruit, not syrups or extracts, but straight up farmers market. the chocolate creeps in slowly, and is more like bakers chocolate than anything else. there is some sweetness from the berries as well as from the middle of the road malt profile. the alcohol isn't tasted until the very finish, but then becomes quite hot. as the beer warms, the alcohol becomes even more potent, but the beer still finishes with a drying feeling. carbonation is underwhelming, but that's indicative of the style more than anything, and the body is plenty big. its certainly a bottle to share, but one of the more enjoyable fruit beers I can ever remember drinking. thanks again to thebrewo for making this experience possible. its a trip in a glass.<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">1,561 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/stonedtrippin.601042/">StonedTrippin</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/2097/11784/?ba=StonedTrippin">May 06, 2013</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="243272" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/thorpe429.243272/"><img alt="Photo of Thorpe429" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/243/243272.jpg?1330444250" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">3.9</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#990000;">-11%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5</span><br/><br/>Shared with bmanning at a tasting in November 2009.<br/><br/>187mL bottle poured in champagne flutes.<br/><br/>A: Pours a dark ruby with a tiny tan head that shines brightly in the flute.<br/><br/>S: Lots of raspberries--nay, raspberry tootsie rolls--sit atop a sweet malt base with a little bit of extra chocolate, and hits of earthiness.<br/><br/>T: Again, this really reminded me of a raspberry tootsie roll filled with a bit of alcohol. The flavors underneath were quite nice, with slight hints of brown sugar/molasses, a bit of maple, and maybe some anise. <br/><br/>M: Medium body with only a bit of carbonation.<br/><br/>D: Very rich in flavor, but without the perfect balance, this one was great to try and sip for a while, but didn't live up to the hype for me.

Finally gettin my chance.<br/><br/>This poured out from a 2007 vintage bottle, reddish brown in color with virtually no head on top. The lacing and retention basically don't exist. The smell is of straight raspberry jam and subtle malt, boozy and sweet. The taste is of tart raspberry with hints of chocolate in there also. The mouthfeel is thick, gently carbonated and smooth. Overall it's an impressive brew, would love to try a fresh bottle someday. Very glad I got to try it!<br/><br/>Sampled the new batch, ultra fresh Sweet Raspberry on the nose, reminds me of Chambord. Subtle chocolate, just overall very sweet and boozy, excellent beer.<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">685 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/knapp85.408506/">Knapp85</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/2097/11784/?ba=Knapp85">May 05, 2013</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="6284" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/brentk56.6284/"><img alt="Photo of brentk56" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/6/6284.jpg?1330299924" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.84</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#006600;">+10.5%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5</span><br/><br/>2004 bottle<br/><br/>Appearance: After exploding from the bottle, pours a hazy black cherry soda color with a head that quickly disappears to a ringlet<br/><br/>Smell: Intense chocolate covered cherry aroma<br/><br/>Taste: The raspberry liquid filled chocolate candy literally coats the tongue and builds in a subtly sour direction by mid-palate; the sour complexity lingers after the swallow as the rich chocolate flavors build in intensity to the finish, which lasts forever<br/><br/>Mouthfeel: Thick and viscous, with modest carbonation<br/><br/>Drinkability: A fantastic sipper that I could enjoy for hours in small doses<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">585 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/brentk56.6284/">brentk56</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/2097/11784/?ba=brentk56">Apr 19, 2008</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="14442" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/beerchitect.14442/"><img alt="Photo of BEERchitect" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/14/14442.jpg?1441339731" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.42</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#006600;">+0.9%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5</span><br/><br/>2007 vintage<br/><br/>The pour brings a lightly carbonated, heavier viscosity beer that has the murky russet appearance of prune juice. Modest head formation that halts at a slight lace. Legging is evident and indicative of the higher alcohols and sugars present in the beer.<br/><br/>Strong aromas of heavy and dried fruits, varying alcohols, and strong scents of port wine, brandy, and sherry. Obviously, raspberries lead the way, but also grapes, plumbs, raisons, dates, figs, and other berries. Backup notes of chocolate, cashews, and almonds gain praise as the beer warms and begins to temper the alcohols.<br/><br/>Flavors are equally as strong and really start to target the chocolate covered fruits of raspberries and cherries. Strong fruitcake and brandy-soaked fruits add a well melded but varying complexity. Lightly vinous and woodsy with tart berries and wood aged wines. Intense alcohol flavors blend the brandy, port, rum, bourbon character and is a bit boozy at first but seem to mellow out as the beer breathes and releases carbonation.<br/><br/>Light carbonation allows me to feel the weight of the sugars and malts- no lift from the surfaces of the mouth. This keeps the beer from becoming as creamy as it could be. Like port wines, this beer is intended as an after dinner delicacy. However, the beer is not as sugary as you'd think, with a hefty malty, woodsy, lightly tart feel. Finishes with a long linger of chocolate covered raspberries and port.<br/><br/>The beer is an interesting and welcomed variety of English Barleywines like Hardy's and Lees. The papery-cardboard oxidation upfront, I can do without but the sherry notes add a lot- much in the same way that Sam Adams Triple Bock does. At first, I wasn't too terribly impressed with the beer but as it warmed and breathed, the raspberry, chocolate and softer alcohols prevailed and improved a lot for me. <br/><br/>Thanks BigMcLargeHuge!<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">1,871 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/beerchitect.14442/">BEERchitect</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/2097/11784/?ba=BEERchitect">Jul 03, 2009</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="2335" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/phyl21ca.2335/"><img alt="Photo of Phyl21ca" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/2/2335.jpg?1330368410" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#990000;">-8.7%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4</span><br/><br/>(6.3 oz bottle, 2004 vintage  drank in January 2006)  Poured a hazy deep red/brown beer with a rather large dark foamy head with great retention. Aroma of raspberry chocolate cake is quite evident with some port-like alcohol sensation. Taste is less sweet then expected as well as raspberry, which I had expected to be more dominant. Instead there is strong chocolate and caramel malt with a semi-sweet ending. Did not fit my expectation but is still very good nonetheless. I would now be very curious to try the raspberry-free eisbock.<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">540 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/phyl21ca.2335/">Phyl21ca</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/2097/11784/?ba=Phyl21ca">Jan 16, 2006</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="99624" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/largadeer.99624/"><img alt="Photo of largadeer" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/99/99624.jpg?1330021265" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.37</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#990000;">-0.2%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4</span><br/><br/>2004 bottle.<br/><br/>Appearance - Comes in a tiny 6.3 oz wax-dipped bottle - nice presentation. Thick and nearly opaque ruddy brown. No head whatsoever, though a touch of carbonation is visible.<br/><br/>Smell - The scent of chocolate-covered raspberries wafts out of the bottle as soon as the cap comes off. Closer inspection reveals notes of caramel and vanilla. I'm not sure if this is oak-aged, but it has a very woody aroma that I find common in oaked beers.<br/><br/>Taste - Sweet-sour raspberries, chocolate and caramel. Pretty decadent stuff. Not as sweet as I was expecting, which may or may not be the result of extended aging; I haven't tried this fresh, so I have nothing to compare it to. Alcohol is felt more than tasted - the beer has a pleasant warming quality in the throat, much like a nice port. The aftertaste is surprisingly dry and gentle, making it easy to reach for another sip.<br/><br/>Mouthfeel - Velvety-smooth and very full on the tongue. Carbonation is gentle but still felt.<br/><br/>Drinkability - Ridiculously drinkable considering the alcohol and sheer weight of the brew. The slightly sour, drying finish really amplifies the drinkability.<br/><br/>Notes - A huge thanks to london1o1 for the chance to try this elusive beer.<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">1,212 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/largadeer.99624/">largadeer</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/2097/11784/?ba=largadeer">Feb 09, 2008</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="17949" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/emerge077.17949/"><img alt="Photo of emerge077" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/17/17949.jpg?1381242592" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">3.35</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#990000;">-23.5%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5</span><br/><br/>2007 vintage, served in a tapered tasting glass. <br/>This is the 2nd bottle of this i've tried, had this vintage before a couple years ago. My opinion of this beer hasn't changed, the experience was virtually the same as the first time.<br/><br/>Pours a murky brown, viscous body, some stray trails of carbonation struggle to reach the surface around the edges. Little to no foam, though a string of bubbles cling to one side when first poured that quickly fade due to the high alcohol. <br/><br/>Smells tooth-meltingly sweet, like liquid candy. Mellow raspberry and tootsie rolls. Some light oxidation, and vague muddled notes of toffee or orange at room temperature. <br/><br/>Raspberry tootsie pop flavor, fairly one-dimensional. Once you taste it, that's all you can taste. No complexity or nuance. Candy sweet, syrupy, rich. Low carbonation, cordial-like. So sweet you almost don't notice the booze. Honestly i'd drink straight Chambord over this, it's basically the same thing minus the tootsie roll flavor. <br/><br/>Thanks to Eric for sharing this one!<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">1,025 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/emerge077.17949/">emerge077</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/2097/11784/?ba=emerge077">Dec 20, 2011</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="3819" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/buckeyenation.3819/"><img alt="Photo of BuckeyeNation" border="0" height="48" src="styles/default/xenforo/avatars/avatar_male_s.png" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.89</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#006600;">+11.6%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5</span><br/><br/>Crepuscular raspberry fudge slurry. I heard the usual 'pffft' on popping the cap, but there was almost no head formation despite my usual high altitude pour. There was a fleeting one finger disk of light brown fizz that is now but a memory. I'm left with a thin ring where beer, glass and air meet, nothing more. I know that high ABV beer is a classic head killer, but this one is a deadly efficient, cold-hearted assassin.<br/><br/>The aroma is fantastic and is unlike any other in the beer world; at least those that I've come in contact with. Kuhnhenn Raspberry Eisbock smells like crushed, ripe raspberries macerated in Chambord and melted bittersweet chocolate. That is not an approximation, that is *exactly* what it smells like. Mind blowing...<br/><br/>... as is the flavor. I can't believe how much this beer tastes like raspberry eau de vie. The fact that it's beer, though, gives it a broader, deeper flavor profile. The flavor profile consists of absolutely perfect proportions of sweet, sticky, chocolate syrup-drizzled toffee pudding, black licorice and concentrated, bursting berry. Each sip (and make no mistake, this is sipper) is pure, rich, sweet pleasure.<br/><br/>The finish is so long that there really isn't a finish. The flavor never leaves the palate, it just lies low until it's permitted to come rushing back with a vengeance with each subsequent sample. The mouthfeel is stickythick and fits the rest of the beer like a velvet glove. <br/><br/>I'm not sure if the exceedingly low level of carbonation was intentional, but I, for one, don't mind a bit. The beer seems almost completely flat when it first enters the mouth, but there's a bubble or two working behind the scenes to keep things moving along. Hard to believe the 13.5% ABV; it drinks at least half that.<br/><br/>Kuhnhenn Raspberry Eisbock is everything that it's been purported to be and more. It is, without question, the best fruit beer that I've ever had and one of the best beers of any style. I am completely gobsmacked by the flawless interdigitation of intense, concentrated, palate crushing flavors of chocolate-dipped caramel, black licorice and black raspberry. Kuhnhenn has a lot to be proud of.<br/><br/>It is my understanding that the brewery will soon be releasing larger, beautifully decked-out, numbered, wax-dipped bottles of this nectar that are rumored to be priced at $30. If so, then it was my pleasure to consume the last of the humble, label-less bottles from '04.

Not much more can be said about the hype surrounding this one, been a long time coming for me to try this. First off, I was thrilled to be able to finally try this one. So much hype surrounding it and I have been trying to get a hold of it for what seemed like forever now, and I was finally able to get a bottle a few weeks ago and have been waiting to try it anxiously. Last night I decided was the night, I was going to be giving this one a try. Went to the cellar and pulled out the 2007 vintage bottle, perfectly chilled to 50.2 degrees, and proceeded to pour this tiny little bottle, 175ml into a Rodenbach Grand Cru Chalice.<br/><br/>A - Poured into my glass with little to know fan fare associated with it. No head at all, no lace, no bubbles, no nothing. Really quite strange, as I expected this behemoth of a beer, in a little tiny bottle mind you, but this was just not there. There was nothing there at all, which to be honest seemed a bit strange to me. The color on it was fantastic, a very deep rusty brown with loads of ruby tinted hints riddled throughout the glass. Really took on a wonderful color and a I was really most impressed by this factor. Though it looked rather lifeless in the glass, the color spoke for itself, just a very nice caramel, hazy and ruddy color, with hints of red, really looked like a dessert filling.<br/><br/>S - The aroma came at you straight out of a Valentine's Day box of chocolate. I really have never had a beer smell like this before. I have had many a dessert beer, Fruit beer, RIS, but nothing that comes close to this. The first thing that came across was a rich blend of toffee and chocolate. Very smooth and rich, even in the aroma, it was like walking into a candy store what came next. Rich tones of raspberry mixing and melting in with everything that came before and after. Hints of oak perhaps, vanilla definitely though. Truly, unlike anything I had been around before. Very sweet, but at the same time, kind of tart. There was a slight touch of alcohol, but barely discernable from the wonderful candy like smells that preceded it.<br/><br/>T - The flavor was like something out of this world. There is really just no other way to describe it. I have truly never had anything like this before, but one thing I can say for sure, this was no beer. This was one of the most decadent desserts I have ever had the pleasure of trying. From the first wave of oak filled caramel that rolled over my tongue, I knew I was in for a treat. Loads of chocolate following this, but weird chocolate, not your normal thick chocolate stout like flavor, rather it was a baking chocolate that was laced, well not really, more like infused with raspberries. The flavor was just wonderful hints of everything but the kitchen sink in this one. Some nice touches of caramel and toffee riddled throughout this thing. I am not even really sure what to call it; it was just a wonderful mixture of so many different flavors. If there was ever a beer that embodied a candied desert it was this. Ok, enough of that, to sum it up in a single sentence, have you ever seen one of those liquor-filled chocolates? If you have, this is what you would WANT it to taste like!<br/><br/>M - The feel was a little odd at first, but then you got used to it. There was literally no carbonation to it at all, which would normally be an automatic downer, but for some reason actually worked quite well on this one. The flavors were enough to stand on their own, and did not need anything in the way of bubbles to bring them to the surface. A really nice finish on this one as well, forgot to mention that. The taste just dragged on and I could literally still taste this one a good five minutes after I had my last sip. Long drawn out sweet caramel and toffee just dominating the finish, with a slightly dry bitter quality.<br/><br/>D - The smoothness of this was insane. I mean this is a classic dessert, and the alcohol is huge in this but I never got a taste of it. Very strange that it would never show up in the flavor, I would have thought it would have been harsher, especially for a recent release, but smooth as silk. I could have kept sipping on this all night long without an issue, but alas, the little six-ounce bottle only stayed around for thirty minutes and was gone.<br/><br/>Overall, this was outstanding. A bit weird at first I will admit that, but once you realize what it is there is truly nothing else like it. I would have to say this was worth all the hype it gets and is really quite good. I would recommend this to anyone.<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">4,591 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/mikesgroove.104485/">mikesgroove</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/2097/11784/?ba=mikesgroove">Feb 15, 2008</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="276274" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/wethorseblanket.276274/"><img alt="Photo of wethorseblanket" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/276/276274.jpg?1330554995" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.36</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#990000;">-0.5%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 3.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4.25</span><br/><br/>Thanks to Drewone for sharing this 2012 bottle last weekend.<br/><br/>A: Pours a clear crimson.

An inkling of oxidation, too.<br/><br/>Taste: Beyond the berry, there are tastes of baking chocolate, blackstrap molasses, maple syrup, and a few choice hunks of gnarled licorice root. You even get a pinch of aromatic tobacco. There's a fair share of oxidation evident. Also, I detect a tiny, tiny touch of roast.

It pours a mostly clear ruby topped by a half-finger at most of off-white foam. The nose comprises deep raspberry jam, a twinge of what seems like vanilla bean in the background, and a slight sense of vinyl. The taste brings in more of the same, with the raspberries shining, some mild booze creeping in, and the vinyl coming through as a stronger pall of plastic. This plastic-ness doesn't fade. The body is a light hefty, with a relatively light carbonation and a thickly fluid feel. Overall, a nice enough fruited eisbock, but that plastic character is in no way endearing and kind of leaves a bad taste in my mouth (in both manners).<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">726 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/tmoney2591.322390/">TMoney2591</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/2097/11784/?ba=TMoney2591">Sep 28, 2013</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="163147" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/jlindros.163147/"><img alt="Photo of jlindros" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/163/163147.jpg?1330109375" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.72</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#006600;">+7.8%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75</span><br/><br/>One of those special beers that somehow eluded me for years.

Very sweet, syrupy candy, raspberry truffle filling and dark choc outside. Little tannic seed stem but the real raspberry seed in there. Rich velvety raspberry and choc, like a black forest cake with raspberry, bakers choc cake. Finish is sticky syrupy but not messy, very little warming booze, sticky finish. <br/><br/>Mouth is thick and velvety, very little carb but very little booze too. <br/><br/>Overall, I had very high expectations for this, and it even surpassed them. Amazing beer.

Poured from a 6.3oz bottle into a flute glass. <br/><br/>A: The beer is a deep reddish brown color, with almost no head and even less lacing. <br/><br/>S: Strong aroma of raspberry, with a background of dark chocolate &amp; caramel. There’s some alcohol detected as well, that’s to be expected with a beer with this high of an ABV. <br/><br/>T: Sweet raspberry &amp; chocolate flavor coats your mouth as you drink it. Out of habit I started out taking larger sips, but then I realized that taking smaller sips seemed to bring out the flavor much more. There’s a mild alcohol warmth, but not as strong as the smell leads you to believe, nor does it seem like it’s even close to the 13.50% ABV. The raspberry sweetness sticks around in a faint after-taste. <br/><br/>M: Extremely smooth and viscous, very low carbonation, medium-to-heavy body, finish is only slightly sticky. <br/><br/>D: Very tasty, not very filling and fact that the ABV is expertly disguised makes this beer dangerously drinkable. It’s a sipper, but I sipped it very quickly.<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">1,099 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/themaniacalone.37950/">TheManiacalOne</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/2097/11784/?ba=TheManiacalOne">Oct 12, 2006</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="3" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/jason.3/"><img alt="Photo of Jason" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/0/3.jpg?1341282914" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.62</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#006600;">+5.5%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4</span><br/><br/>Thanks to BA ThomasHardy for the sample.<br/> <br/>Cute little 6.3 oz wax topped green bottle with the vintage date of 2004 on it.<br/> <br/>A- Thin fizzy off-white head, never really expect much here being a higher alcohol brew.

Maroon wax hides the pry-off pressure cap. 12.7 fl oz. <br/><br/>Acquired: Via trade. Thanks to Soonerchamps for the bottle!<br/><br/>Reviewed live at low altitude in Austin, TX.<br/><br/>Vintage: 2012.<br/>ABV: 15.5%.<br/>Style: Fruited Eisbock.<br/>Serving temp: Cold. Allowed to warm over the course of consumption.<br/>Serving vessel: Goblet.<br/>Expectations: Sky-high. This is currently #190 on the Top 250 beer list, and #31 on the Top 100 Great Lakes list. It's also the #1 Eisbock if you ignore beers with 4 or less ratings.<br/><br/>No bubble show forms as it's poured.<br/><br/>HEAD: Even with an invigorated pour, no real head emerged - just a thin white floater cap that disappeared completely within 20 seconds, leaving no lacing.<br/><br/>BODY: Deep dark opaque amber/ruby. No yeast or hop sediment is visible.<br/><br/>Appears undercarbonated. It's generally appealing for the style. At 15.5%, I can excuse the lack of head.<br/><br/>AROMA: Sweet yet tart raspberry lends the most appealing note to this aroma, with subtle chocolate notes and sweet dark malts filling it out nicely. It's appealing jammy and jelly-like, with a sort of pie filling note where the fruit comes in. Maybe I'm crazy, but I also pick up on dark cherry notes and tootsie roll. It's not real sour. The cleanliness of the aroma is odd, with no ale esters in there; lager yeast is indicated. Hints of dessert wine (port, mainly) and sweet dark fruit like figs, grapes, and dates emerge as it warms. Fruitcake does come to mind.<br/><br/>It's an arresting, unique aroma, and has my mouth watering. Shockingly, I don't detect any booze or alcohol.<br/><br/>Aromatic intensity: moderate. Not the strong booze bomb I was expecting, but it's absolutely on the sweeter side.<br/><br/>TASTE: Decadent rich black cherry duels with slightly tart raspberry for dominance, and the only victor is the drinker. These fruits are nicely accentuated by a rich dark chocolate character and some tootsie roll characteristics (including a distinct nuanced caramel unlike anything I've come across in a beer afore). Rich dessert wine (definitely port), hints of fruit liqueur, and faint fruitcake notes emerge more and more as it comes to temperature. Nicely jammy, evoking a breakfast pastry filling. Some might even find it redolent of pop tarts or raspberry truffle. Liqueur-filled chocolates also come to mind. Maybe brandy?<br/><br/>It's got a great amber malt backbone which feels more English in character than anything else. There's ample malty sweetness, and I quite like that aspect of the brew. I haven't smoked tobacco before, but I feel comfortable noting a tobacco note here - based on my experience with its aroma alone.<br/><br/>I'm not finding any oak or bourbon notes. It's certainly not yeasty either, and there's no off-character.<br/><br/>Depth of flavour: Nice.<br/>Flavour duration: Above average.<br/>Flavour intensity: Average.<br/>Flavour amplitude: Good.<br/><br/>It's definitely balanced, and the alcohol warmth in the stomach is a nice feature rather than a burden. It's a well built eisbock, no doubt, and the fruit juice is incorporated very well. There's more complexity here than in most eisbocks or doppelbocks, but I can definitely envision an even more intricate example of the style. There's ample cohesion here, and it's almost gestalt. Absolutely a dessert brew but not cloyingly sweet; I'll finish this bottle alone.<br/><br/>The booze-soaked fruit and the liqueur notes are divine, and really stand out. The dark cherry actually eclipses the raspberry.<br/><br/>Constructively, the raspberry and cherry - great as they are - could be more expressive, with a higher depth of flavour. More tart and woody notes would be ideal.<br/><br/>TEXTURE: Plump, viscous, and sticky (like taffy), without ever coming off too syrupy or heavy on the palate - which is shocking at this high an ABV. Smooth and wet. How is it this mellow on the palate? There's no booze or alcohol heat. Definitely full-bodied and thick, but not overbearing. It's heavy and has plenty of heft (to style).<br/><br/>Not oily, gushed, astringent, harsh, rough, or scratchy.<br/><br/>There's great presence on the palate, the carbonation is near perfect (i.e. it's light, lending itself naturally to the liqueur like creaminess), and the sticky thick feel does accentuate the fruits...but I don't know that this elevates the beer per se.<br/><br/>OVERALL: Not the heavy syrupy boozy sipper I expected. It disguises its 15.5% ABV quite well. This is a solid dessert beer, and I'll enjoy finishing it. Would develop with age, definitely. Of the very few beers produced in this style worldwide, this definitely deserves to be in the conversation about the best one. Rminds me of Sam Adams Utopias in its liqueur-evocative luxurious taste. This only improves as it comes to temperature. The discerning drinker will love this beer.<br/><br/>This could easily be the best Eisbock in the world at present, but I can imagine it better. In any case, this is incredible stuff, and I see why it has its esteemed reputation. Worth trading for, by all means.<br/><br/>High B+ (3.95)<br/><br/>Serve w/ liqueur chocolates, plum, raisin, and fig.<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">4,999 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/kojevergas.492136/">kojevergas</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/2097/11784/?ba=kojevergas">Mar 09, 2015</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="304205" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/rifugium.304205/"><img alt="Photo of Rifugium" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/304/304205.jpg?1330109976" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.39</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#006600;">+0.2%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5</span><br/><br/>Thanks a bunch to Zack for sharing this one! I've been wanting to try this, but just never (until now)had the opportunity.<br/><br/>2012 vintage (I think?)<br/><br/>Thick, dark pour, black cherry color, minimal head (though a slight ringlet briefly retained), alcohol legs on the glass as opposed to lacing. Aroma was thick with raspberry and chocolaty malts, molasses, raw cake batter, some brandy-like booze heat, distant and non-offensive phenols. Nice lush flavor, raspberry jam with traces of tartness, Tootsie Rolls, caramel, dark malts, but little to no roast in there--it's just too sweet for that--somewhat earthy with a very subtle bitterness coming out as the beer warmed, brandy/cordial/[minor solventy] booziness not held back, although for only being a year old, I didn't find this hot at all. Felt in the head more than on the palate, I guess would be one way of describing it. Mouthfeel was smooth, body was full, sweet, but I wouldn't call it cloying at all. Very nice melding of flavors between the raspberry and thick/distilled malts. <br/><br/>I don't think I'd pay top dollar or trade away whalezbro to obtain this beer, but it was definitely a nice experience, and I hope to come across it again sometime.<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">1,203 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/rifugium.304205/">Rifugium</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/2097/11784/?ba=Rifugium">Jul 04, 2013</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="93332" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/rblwthacoz.93332/"><img alt="Photo of RblWthACoz" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/93/93332.jpg?1429668864" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.38</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev 0%<br/><span class="muted">look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4</span><br/><br/>First off, I can understand why this comes in 6.5 ounce bottles. Second off, wow. <br/><br/>Pours a ruby tint with absolutely no head. Nose is total raspberry funk with what seems like almost a plastic type of character to it. Flavor is strong raspberry with thick malts. I never really felt that alcohol was present flavor wise. Feel is a bit thicker on liquid and low on carbonation. I also get a slight gritty kind of edge. Not so much that it ruins the experience, but enough to notice. I kind of take it like it is one step below being too much. If it was pushed any further, it wouldn't work. But overall, it does work since it is so damn unique. I have to say that two ounces of this would probably be good enough for me unless I had a long while to really dwell on the bottle or in this case what was served to me off the tap.<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">826 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/rblwthacoz.93332/">RblWthACoz</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/2097/11784/?ba=RblWthACoz">Dec 31, 2007</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="19986" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/russpowell.19986/"><img alt="Photo of russpowell" border="0" height="48" src="styles/default/xenforo/avatars/avatar_male_s.png" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.56</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#006600;">+4.1%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 2.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5</span><br/><br/>Thanks to googzoid10 for letting me try one I've been wanting for a while!<br/><br/>Mine is 11.9% ABV from 07<br/><br/>Pours a very still chestnut with minimal head &amp; an oily sheen.

Raspberry flavor is shy at first, but peeks out eventually (in aroma and taste)...<br/>...which is where we're going next...tastes like brandy at first, until raspberry slips through, under the coat of çognac...and the result is utterly unheard of ...a graceful, powerful thing, some nuts, chocolate charge the palate elegantly...a sublime sipper and a rich elixir, all at once.<br/>After further examination, "absolutely gorgeous" is good as I can get, for now...uncanny, this balance, this magnificent marriage, and this perfect play of flavors, that harmonizes to create a gentle blend that delivers a rare, unheard-of experience in the flavor, and all throught the experience.<br/>Fantastic balance: never too strong, too dark, too rich, just right...slick, yet graceful, not sickly, not treacly, somehow just the perfect match of a strong dark lager and the raspberry flavor, with enchanting yeast...a magical match of cookie + fruit + liquor.<br/>There's a slight bite, a bit of hops, then all is mellow, you never really feel the 13%, it's a sly, subtle sophisticated combination.<br/>Full-bodied, yet not fulsome, and wholly memorable. Unique among beers, this has a flavor and a transcendent effect not felt in many other beers.<br/>They did their work well at Kuhnhenn, and crafted a masterpiece...a $30 bottle masterpiece, though? Ehhh???<br/>Definitely a special occasion beer, and after-dinner dessert brew, only for revelling and toasting, something to mellow the mood and usher in an unheard of feeling among all in company...not an any-old-day beer, by any means.<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">1,868 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/feloniousmonk.1022/">feloniousmonk</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/2097/11784/?ba=feloniousmonk">Jun 11, 2005</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="414386" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/mdfb79.414386/"><img alt="Photo of mdfb79" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/414/414386.jpg?1329962957" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.59</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#006600;">+4.8%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5</span><br/><br/>From 02/06/11 notes.
