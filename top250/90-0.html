A latticework of lace lines the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, dark fruits, cocoa powder, and an alcohol aroma. Taste is of dark roasted malt, slightly sour dark fruits, bittersweet chocolate, and some roasted coffee bean flavors. A mild roasty bitterness lingers on the palate with each sip. There is a bit of a soy sauce quality in both the smell and taste but it's not at all unpleasant. This beer has a smooth and creamy mouthfeel with a lower level of carbonation. Overall, this is a very good RIS that deserves its status as a highly acclaimed beer. I am very happy I finally was able to snag one of these.<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">826 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/uclabrewn84.439438/">UCLABrewN84</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/13014/33127/?ba=UCLABrewN84">Oct 31, 2011</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="601042" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/stonedtrippin.601042/"><img alt="Photo of StonedTrippin" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/601/601042.jpg?1333578452" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.25</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#990000;">-3.8%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25</span><br/><br/>my first darkness, as is common with many of my lucky rare beer scores, thanks to drlovemd87 for hooking this up for us last night. an impressive example of the style for sure, but a top 50 quality beer? I don't know. its rather straightforward as they go, excellent no doubt, but it reminds me of a great many other stouts like this out there on the market. rich creamy dark brown pour, sudsy mocha head, dense but not thick, attractive. the nose is muted dark roasted barley and unsweetened bakers chocolate. no alcohol at all, extremely impressive. the flavor, and I love this feature in this style, is all about the grain. I taste a few layers of varying roasted barley and chocolate malt, but no coffee, no vanilla, no bourbon barrel, no oak, none of that stuff. I do taste some dried cherry type notes in the finish, and as it warms even more fruit comes out, but this is a no frills example of the style, and I appreciate it for that. perhaps most impressive is that its massive alcoholic content is entirely absent from the smell and taste, its just not there. a real creeper, something to look out for when drinking darkness. I loved it with chocolate cookies, and could imagine a million other food pairings for it. expert quality stuff, but not different enough from some of the others for me to rate it off the charts. great beer though, they all are from surly.<br/><br/>edit: some age makes this epic, just cracked a 2011, and was amazed how much more mature and integrated and evolved the beer was from the fresh version, it really is one of the best in the game, with a chocolate and raisin complex coming to the fore. improving a few scores to reflect that.<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">1,666 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/stonedtrippin.601042/">StonedTrippin</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/13014/33127/?ba=StonedTrippin">Dec 09, 2013</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="243272" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/thorpe429.243272/"><img alt="Photo of Thorpe429" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/243/243272.jpg?1330444250" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.55</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#006600;">+2.9%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5</span><br/><br/>Thanks for Jerk44 for hooking me up with some of this at Dark Lord Day 2009.<br/><br/>A: Very dark with a dark head to go along with it.<br/><br/>S: Roasted malt and the sweetness of dried fruits.

There is a nice retention with a good lacing as well. The smell of the beer is of dark berries with deep roasted malts chocolate and subtle vanilla and soy. The taste is the beer is really nice, bold roasted malts, some smoke and bit of dark chocolate, there is a touch of saltiness in there too. The mouthfeel is silky smooth with a creamy body and subtle carbonation. Overall it's excellent.

Absolute chocolatey notes with licorice and char blend beautifully in this molassas-rich Imperial Stout.<br/><br/>An very viscous pour of oily black liquid falls from the bottle- this is going to be one full beer. Completely opaque, the beer lathers into a thick, lightly browned, dense foam stance that seemingly never waivers. Both lacing and legging have a convincing say in the coatings left behind on the glass.<br/><br/>Robust aromas of both semi-sweet chocolate morsels and dry cocoa powder lead the way with a heafty sidekick of burnt cherries, licorice, rum, and fruitcake. Mouthwatering and seductive, the aromas are near flawlessness.<br/><br/>The chocolate-heavy tone continues in flavor, similar to fresh baked brownies and Hershey syrups. Background fruity notes of cherries, grapes, currants, and dates are accompanied by deep roasted coffee, char, and roasted marshmallows creaminess. Molassas sweetness brings these flavors together seamlessly while giving a soothing taste to the aggressive roast.<br/><br/>Full, viscous, creamy, and oily in mouthfeel, the beer has a slow transition from early thickness to a late sweet, warming, and bitter finish (bitterness is in form of both char and hops). This beer is obviously intended for after dinner compliments or in place of dinner alltogether.<br/><br/>A special thanks goes out to Shango42 for the unique opportunity to finally enjoy this beer.

Aroma of roasted malt and black chocolate with some light liquorice and dry coffee notes is quite enjoyable. Taste is also a heavy mix between some roasted malt with light bitter notes with rich black chocolate notes and very subtle notes of liquorice and dry fruits. Sweetness is very well balanced and not nearly as cloying as Dark Lord. Body is full with good carbonation and warming notes are perceptible though nothing too heavy.

The beer itself has a pitch black body with two fingers of thick brown froth. Rings of lace cling to the rim of the glass as the head slowly falls. Off to a good start.<br/><br/>Smell: Smoky, meaty, a bit burnt actually. Make that burnt sugar. Citrusy hops are still noticeable despite the age of the bottle, almost a year at this point. This must have been a beast when it was fresh. There's an undercurrent of molasses that's fairly pleasant, but this is somewhat rough on the whole.<br/><br/>Taste &amp; mouthfeel: Molasses, charcoal, pervasive roasty bitterness. There's a spiciness that appears mid-sip, bringing to mind anise or fennel. Thick as hell; this is like drinking a pint of whole milk. Whole milk that someone tossed a piece of charcoal into, that is. The finish is charred and extremely hoppy for the style, with a lingering, somewhat acrid aftertaste that sticks to the tongue even after you've brushed your teeth and gargled with mouthwash. This is certainly complex, but I can't say that I'd ever want to drink it again.<br/><br/>Drinkability: Interesting stuff, but finishing an entire glass is a chore.<br/><br/>Notes: My least favorite beer from Surly so far, I'm sorry to say. It's unique, and possibly even worth trying given the chance, but it's not worth all the hoopla.<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">1,356 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/largadeer.99624/">largadeer</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/13014/33127/?ba=largadeer">Oct 01, 2008</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="17949" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/emerge077.17949/"><img alt="Photo of emerge077" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/17/17949.jpg?1381242592" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.55</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#006600;">+2.9%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4</span><br/><br/>On-tap at Local Option, Maproom, and Hopleaf...first pour at Maproom was brimming with foam, at Hopleaf it was gushing from the glass like a muddy volcano. Jet black with a huge cap of lacy tan foam. Over time it forms sheets of webby lacing. <br/><br/>Fruity hop in the nose, Amarillo maybe, tangerine or mango, even juicyfruit gum a little. Hops are aggressive, at 80 IBU's, but the aroma is definitely clean and measured. <br/><br/>Initial burst of fruity/spicy hops are steamrolled by a dense charred chocolate, that lingers for a long time, underscored by earthy, bitter hops. Cocoa blends with a lightly astringent roast in the finish that suggests a quality blend of exotic coffee. Not overbearing, it hides the abv well. <br/><br/>A viscous and velvety mouthfeel, with somewhat low-level carbonation, that still manages to be effervescent. After three, i've reached my limit, but that's a testament to an easily drinkable RIS.

Necrosis black that crowds the sides and bowl of the glass so completely that light doesn't stand a chance in hell. Nothing is visible except... Darkness. The coffee colored cap looks as though it won't fade completely until sometime tomorrow, and there's a surprising amount of lace that can only be described as eye candy. I'm well aware that glassware shouldn't be taken into account when assigning an appearance score, but Darkness in a Darkness snifter is perfection.<br/><br/>Believe it or not, the hops can still be appreciated in the nose after almost a year. I guess that means they were added with a heavy hand back in '07. They're far from numero uno, though. As expected, ridiculously roasted malt is a rompin' and a stompin' all over the joint. Dark chocolate is at least twice as strong as black coffee. I've smelled better, but the nose is good. Damn good.<br/><br/>Believe the hype. My first impression is that Darkness tastes like no other RIS. I'm not sure I'll be able to explain why that is... but it is. My second impression is that a tremendous amount of green hop flavor and bitterness has survived. This stuff just might give Old Crustacean a run for its money when fresh.<br/><br/>Even though the malt backbone is massive, this beast isn't anywhere near as thick and syrupy as Dark Lord (which might make it more drinkable). Some of the bitterness could also be coming from barley that has been fire-roasted to within an inch of its life. The result is a flavor profile that includes chocolate liquor, blackstrap molasses and large splashes of Sambuca and espresso.<br/><br/>If Darkness was limited to those flavors, it would still be exceptional beer. The fact that candied citrus peel and resiny pine sap are added to the mix puts it over the top for this hophead. I can see how some might not like the emphasis on the little green cones, but then this is Surly... what the hell did you expect?<br/><br/>With each eager gulp, I am making Darkness prove every one of the final three scores. Believe me, it more than lives up to the challenge of a critical palate, especially since the flavors become even better integrated as the beer picks up a few degrees. The alcohol provides warmth (not heat) and plenty of power. This is massive beer for massive beer lovers.<br/><br/>My first inclination was to give the mouthfeel a less than perfect score. However, as the middle portion of the bottle approaches, it will not be denied. The melted ice cream-like viscosity that was almost there initially is now there in spades. Carbonation is on the generous side, but it's so soft and so well-buried that it adds just the right amount of energy and lift.<br/><br/>Darkness is a masterful creation from a masterful brewer. I allowed a few doubts to creep in prior to cracking the crown, but I doubt no more. In an amazingly short period of time, Surly has entered the upper echelon of craft breweries with such all-out masterpieces as Furious, Bender and CynicAle. Darkness is simply the shiny, juicy cherry on top. A huge thanks to feloniousmonk, the consummate BA, for the best extra in the history of extras.<br/><br/>*originally reviewed on 10-08-2008<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">3,136 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/buckeyenation.3819/">BuckeyeNation</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/13014/33127/?ba=BuckeyeNation">Oct 27, 2009</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="63854" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/zeff80.63854/"><img alt="Photo of zeff80" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/63/63854.jpg?1405301675" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.63</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#006600;">+4.8%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5</span><br/><br/>2010 Edition<br/><br/>A - Poured out an opaque, jet black color with a two-finger, brown head of foam with large effervescent bubbles.

I was lucky enough to acquire this bottle through a very fair trade from a good friend. When I see how much these things go for and the hype surrounding it, it is hard for me to justify it sometimes. I have found several instances where these beers are just complete letdowns. This here was not the case. It was absolutely wonderful and I really think it is worth its reputation. That being said, I new this would be the only bottle I would get so I saved it for a very special occasion and split it with a good friend at Barley's last night for my 30th Birthday. I figured it would be a fitting place, fitting time, and fitting company to open such a rare and sought after treat. Served in multiple sampling glasses at various temperatures up to room temp, this was definitely a wonderful experience. Bottle # 295.<br/><br/>Appearance - So we finally get to pour this one out. Opened the double dipped, wax topped cap and pour out this black as night liquid. Deep dark notes of black, to which no light could penetrate dropped into the glass with each tip. A mushrooming head of tan foam then came up over the top, reaching a height of at least two fingers before starting to break up into a rocky and cratered field. Even at its lowest mark it still carried about a fingers depth of lace with it and the side glass webbing was extremely nice. Overall this was a monster looking beer, however I cannot say it was a five, only because I have seen Dark Lord and the Abyss offer me a slightly fuller poor.<br/><br/>Smell - The aroma was to die for, literally. Everyone of these big RIS are much different then the one before, and everyone one is so unique, but I think once you take a whiff of this one it becomes very clear that this is in a whole different category. Gone are you rum soaked dark fruit and bourbon barrel, oak infused aromas, this was an entirely different beast. Rich and very sweet cocoa aromas are bringing themselves up to greet you first, with a gentle nudge of alcohol underneath. Wonderfully rich coffee then comes in to deliver the next blow. It was more of a roasted coffee bean aroma to be honest, like when you first open up that drawer at starbucks. A veritable assault of floral hops then comes out of nowhere. Grapefruit and pineapple hints mixing in with molasses and vanilla, what was this. As it warmed that sweet and creamy chocolate and coffee just really stole the show, with drops of vanilla just making this one drip with sweetness.<br/><br/>Taste - Now, we dive in to get a taste of what this wonderful liquid could be hiding. The first thing you notice is uber sweet chocolate and coffee. Just that wonderful taste that you want to have in a big stout, but the second that you get used to it, it gets cut like a knife, infused with grapefruit and orange peel. Puckering the lips as fresh grass and lemon hints seal it up and dry the mouth instantly before falling down the back of your through and opening up the scarred taste buds to welcome rush of vanilla. Beautifully complex, the rich notes of smoke and molasses intermingle and marry a wonderful peat like darkness that just sits there for a second before it too passes, getting whisked away and leaving behind only the faintest hint of grapefruit like bitterness soaked in vanilla and coffee. A wonderful voyage of unexpected tastes and bright surprises, wit ha virtually hidden alcohol content that makes it oh so smooth.<br/><br/>Mouthfeel - An speaking of smooth, wow, this was one smooth stout. A little bit less full then the rest of the big boys, but again this was a different type of monster, something entirely different then you milk shake like consistency you would typically associate with the style. This had a light, more carbonated feel to it. A much drier beer, especially in the finish, the flavors exploded out of it more then soaked in and sat there. As it warmed up it really did get a good deal thicker, but still stuck to its roots, setting it apart from the heard.<br/><br/>Drinkability - As for an almost 11% ABV Russian Imperial Stout, this was something I could have drank all night long. It was just tremendous in its complexity with a unrivaled smoothness. The alcohol was nowhere to be found, and the dry, hoppy finish only encouraged me to go back and try it again, and again, and again. It was a sad moment when this bottle was finished, as I really wanted just a little bit more. It was like beer crack for me, really just that good.<br/><br/>Overall I would have to say this really lived up to the hype for me. It was a phenominal beer, much different then anything I had before it, and was a nice breath of fresh air in the category. I was impressed by the floral hoppiness that was brought into this, especially in the finish as it really hid the alcohol well and let you have a nice, and not super filling experience out of it. Overall would I like another bottle, absolutely! Would I travel to Minnesota to get it, if the wife would let me, in a heartbeat!<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">4,992 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/mikesgroove.104485/">mikesgroove</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/13014/33127/?ba=mikesgroove">Jun 13, 2008</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="222552" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/womencantsail.222552/"><img alt="Photo of womencantsail" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/222/222552.jpg?1362965777" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.08</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#990000;">-7.7%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4</span><br/><br/>Review #300 comes courtesy of mikesgroove. Thanks again Mike for hooking it up with this one.<br/><br/>2009 Vintage<br/><br/>A: The pour is viscous, black, and wonderful. It fills the glass with a fluffy mocha colored head on top of the thick liquid below.<br/><br/>S: Generally with an RIS (or any stout, really) you don't expect citrus and pine hops to be the primary aroma, but that's just what we have here. The malt and other traditional RIS aromas don't come through quite as much as I would have liked. Still, the malt and chocolate and coffee do come through at times.<br/><br/>T: The hoppiness is still present on the tongue, but not quite as intensely. A good roasted malt background with some hints of coffee and chocolate. Perhaps a bit of dark fruits as well, which go interestingly with the hoppiness.<br/><br/>M: The body is nice and full and the beer feels quite creamy on the tongue. The carbonation is at a moderate level.<br/><br/>D: D: The booze is hidden very well by the myriad of flavors that are present. I wish, however, that this was more RIS like and not basically a black DIPA.<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">1,057 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/womencantsail.222552/">womencantsail</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/13014/33127/?ba=womencantsail">Jan 05, 2010</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="8942" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/chaingangguy.8942/"><img alt="Photo of ChainGangGuy" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/8/8942.jpg?1330544840" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.35</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#990000;">-1.6%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5</span><br/><br/>2008 Vintage.<br/><br/>Appearance: Pours an inky black body with a large, frothy, light tan head.<br/><br/>Smell: Roasty, burnt malt nose with strong notes of dark chocolate liqueur, coffee, smoky creosote, and pine needles.<br/><br/>Taste: Roasty, dark, chocolaty maltiness displays both depth and richness. A few spoonfuls of frothed cream pairs with a flavor of strong coffee. Bracing amount of sweetness present. Vinous fruity character. Touch of creosote. Strong pine and citrus hoppiness though not unreasonably so. The bitterness makes a decent attempt, but, for me, it doesn't ever even begin to overtake the malt sweetness.

Just a hint of alcohol warmth.<br/><br/>Mouthfeel: Thick body with extremely smooth carbonation and just a touch of dryness in the finish.<br/><br/>Overall: This beer lives up to it's hype. Better than I remember when I had the 2010 version. I'll definitely have another some time.<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">789 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/oline73.371504/">oline73</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/13014/33127/?ba=oline73">Apr 21, 2012</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="322390" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/tmoney2591.322390/"><img alt="Photo of TMoney2591" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/322/322390.jpg?1330006104" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.23</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#990000;">-4.3%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4</span><br/><br/>Served in a snifter at The Barley House.<br/><br/>Who'd've thought that one of my personal whales would beach itself 'round here? Hey, I'm not gonna argue. Its pour verifies its name, as nothing but straight darkness sits in the glass, a finger-thick tan chapeau sitting jauntily on top. The nose comprises raisins, rum, blackened oats, figs, chocolate-covered strawberries, roasted malts, light molasses, and a very slight fusel scent streaming from the base. The taste holds notes of roasted malts, chocolate syrup, molasses, maple syrup, figs, oak, brown sugar, light orange flesh, and a touch of Belgian yeastiness. Honestly, the last two were a bit surprising, but definitely can't be considered detracting, as they add a refreshing complexity to a usually brutish style. The body is pretty hefty, with a light moderate carbonation and a chewy feel. Overall, I was not at all disappointed by this, though the one thing I would note is that it's a tad lighter and fizzier than I expected. But this was a minor issue at best, smothered by the overall tastiness.<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">1,056 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/tmoney2591.322390/">TMoney2591</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/13014/33127/?ba=TMoney2591">Nov 17, 2010</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="113426" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/kegatron.113426/"><img alt="Photo of Kegatron" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/113/113426.jpg?1330278991" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.58</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#006600;">+3.6%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5</span><br/><br/>750 ml wax topped bottle into an oversized Duvel tulip glass. Thanks go to bulldogp04 for the trade. I had previously had samples of the '07 batch both from the bottle and keg (@ EBF '08) and was anxiously waiting to see what this latest batch brings to the table. <br/><br/>An aggressive pour into the glass yields an inky black that more than lives up to its namesake. This thing is just is an absolute impenetrable pitch dark with 2 fingers of fantastic looking thick and creamy burnt mocha colored head. This simmers down into a thin yet sturdy layer of retention that fires up magnificently when swirled, just absolutely COATING the sides of the glass with frothy swathes of lacing. This is just beautiful looking in my glass. The first thought that crosses my mind as I initially sniff this, is how exceedingly fresh, floral, and hoppy this aroma is. Fortunately, this is just the beginning of a most excellent bouquet, as the aroma's hop profile gives way to some powerful Stout qualities. Baker's chocolate, roast, smoke, coffee, molasses, dark fruits, and finally some light heat. Damn, there is a ton packed into this nose! <br/><br/>The taste is large and in charge on the palette, with a beefy mix of smoky and sticky tasting blackstrap molasses, chocolate covered cherries, brown sugar, roasted malts and coffee that blend into a firmer feeling hop bitterness in the backend. I will say that as this warms and sits and the carbonation lowers, the hop profile lessens as well, leaving behind a sweet, tangy, warm, and slightly bitter viscous mess that I'm just loving every minute of! The mouthfeel is huge and chewy feeling (definitely up there with Dark Lord and Expedition Stout on the thickness scale) with a massive creamy body up front that works itself into a more prickly feel in the middle, before it slides into a oily and viscous feel in the back. The ABV that is present in the body is hefty and warming but it never gets boozy or stinging at all. As a matter of fact, it feels just right considering the huge amount of flavors that are at work here. <br/><br/>This beer kind of gives new meaning to the phrase "demon in a bottle", as this beastly beer possessed my soul from the get go and didn't let go until the last drop was drained from the glass. Powerful feeling and complex, this is up there in rarified top RIS status for me. I will say that this definitely came off as much sweeter than other top picks in the style but I didn't mind at all. There was enough bitterness to keep it in check, plus I really liked how this aspect differentiated it from some of the other top Imperial Stouts out there. This was awesome stuff that I'm really happy to have finally been able to sit down and enjoy a full bottle of it.<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">2,722 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/kegatron.113426/">Kegatron</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/13014/33127/?ba=Kegatron">Jan 15, 2009</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="163147" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/jlindros.163147/"><img alt="Photo of jlindros" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/163/163147.jpg?1330109375" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.18</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#990000;">-5.4%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4</span><br/><br/>'10 Vampire vintage, thanks to Levifunk,	grub, and bsuedekum for various bottles of this awesome beer.<br/><br/>Awesome huge head, thick frothy and creamy, dark head, forms layers as I pour between glasses, pitch black thick beer with nice legs, tons of lacing. essentially the perfect head.<br/><br/>Nose brings lots of chocolate, bakers, dark, cocoa nibs, bit of roast and coffee, lots of vanilla, bit of caramel, lots of dark malts bit of bitter roast and earthy hops.<br/><br/>Taste starts a bit of soy sauce, lots of bitter roasted malts, coffee, syrupy, big and heavy, roasty, some light oats, slightly briny, lots of vanilla, caramel, molasses, slight booze, bitter astringent roasted malts and bit of earthy hop.

Poured from a 750ml bottle into an imperial pint glass.<br/><br/>A: The beer is a deep black color, with a large light brown head that fades very slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass.<br/><br/>S: The aroma contains roasted malts, dark fruit, licorice, chocolate, coffee and a touch of hops.<br/><br/>T: The taste starts out with a very hearty roasted malt character that is quickly followed by strong and sweet flavors of chocolate, coffee, licorice and dark fruit. There is no hint of the 10.30% ABV. The hops presence is very mild as you would expect but there’s enough to provide a good balance. The after-taste is slightly sweet.<br/><br/>M: Crisp, very smooth and quite viscous, heavy body, medium carbonation, finish is slightly sticky.<br/><br/>O: Tasty, goes down dangerously easily, slightly filling, strong kick, very good representation of style, not only is it an excellent stout to drink for as long as you can handle it, it seems to have held up quite well for over 3 years.<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">1,068 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/themaniacalone.37950/">TheManiacalOne</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/13014/33127/?ba=TheManiacalOne">Dec 06, 2012</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="102045" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/slatetank.102045/"><img alt="Photo of Slatetank" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/102/102045.jpg?1443628021" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.48</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#006600;">+1.4%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5</span><br/><br/>Thanks to bmoyer0301 for breaking this out recently -enjoyed cellar temp in standard pint. <br/><br/>This is a beautiful stout, looks thick and black as it is poured with some espresso-like crema for head with ultra tight bead. The aromas of brownie batter and baker's cocoa's semi-bitter/semi-sweet scents with mild dark fruit from the yeast which is plummy. The stout has a light sweet hop odor with more berry tinge with the dark toasted malt nose as it is swirled. The feel is rich, viscous, sweet fruit and little drying as it is moved around the mouth. The mellow spiciness of this gives some complexity and the texture is generally creamy with a pretty mild alcohol influence. <br/><br/> Darkness has a taste of bitter cocoa which is familiar for Russian imperial because it has a lightly bitter nutty taste up front with some astringent coffee-like dark mallt elements and raisiny dried fruit aspect. There is a earthy woody and almost light anise taste which comes forward as it warms with mild burnt malt quality as it finishes. This is an extremely drinkable beer for the abv, I found myself having to regulate my gulps and respect the big stout for what it is. I enjoyed how easy it goes down with an almost burnt marshmallow-like caramel essence that bring out a bit of concentrated dark sugar flavor.

I was extremely excited to try this per its reputation. Reviewed from notes. <br/><br/>**This review largely reflects the 2011 Darkness, but I did try the 2012 Darkness as well and found it more hop-forward<br/><br/>A: Pours a two finger beautiful tan colour head of excellent cream, thickness, and retention (considering the ABV). Colour is a solid black. <br/><br/>Sm: Brilliant mix of cream, coffee, chocolate, and nuts. A light strength aroma. <br/><br/>T: Heavy (yet subtle) chocolate, coffee, and wonderful cream lacing. Rich and complex. The alcohol does come through unfortunately, which jabs into the otherwise well-executed balance. It's surprisingly hop-forward for the style. Dark malt and caramel heavy. It's quite well built, though I don't think its ABV is warranted. It'd be better at a lower ABV so the flavours could come out. I do quite enjoy it otherwise. <br/><br/>Mf: Smooth, creamy, and wet, but too thick. More dryness and coarseness would be ideal; it feels more like a porter than a stout as is. <br/><br/>Dr: Hard to drink due to the ABV (and more importantly, how obvious it makes itself), but the mouthfeel makes it slide down easily. I like its subtlety. It's pricey and hard to find, but I do like it. I don't know that it's worth seeking out like some other Russian imperial stouts.<br/><br/>B<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">1,343 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/kojevergas.492136/">kojevergas</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/13014/33127/?ba=kojevergas">Dec 19, 2011</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="304205" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/rifugium.304205/"><img alt="Photo of Rifugium" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/304/304205.jpg?1330109976" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">3.83</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#990000;">-13.3%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 3.75</span><br/><br/>2012 vintage.<br/>*sigh* Another overhyped beer.<br/><br/>Looked like a stout should: dark brown-black pour, with a small tan head that sank to a ringlet and left some splashes of lace on the glass. Aroma was typical as far as stouts go, dark roasty malts, some cocoa bitterness, with notes of herbal hops and anise. Same story on the palate, dark malts, dark chocolate, herbal hops, light woody notes, and a touch of dark fruits and licorice; slightly lingering resiny bitterness in the aftertaste. Good, but not very full in flavor like a good stout should be. I'm not really understanding the hype over this beer...you get about the same effect as you would from a Storm King, and I can get that off the shelf any day of the week. Not full-bodied, but on the heavier side of medium.

Tannish lace stays long on the glass. This bleak cast may scare away the timid, those less ready to tango with the Stygian side, but the nose entices me in, and am undaunted as I step into the dark.<br/><br/>A blast of coffee hits first, married with copious cocoa, bitter and sweet stand side by side, neither in dominance. Hints of dark rum, molasses, black pepper and anise are mixed in this aroma of this heady brew, and it only gets richer the more you drink it in the nose. Sweeter elements eventually take charge, but it's still a deep, almost spicy blend.<br/><br/>To taste: Massive mouthfeel, thick, gooey, and absolutely delicious. Chocolate is in full force, but matched once more with earthier aspects, the coffee, the spice, the slick black strap. Incredibly pervasive on the palate, this stout commands every inch of the senses, sending tasty tendrils up in each crack in the cavern of the mouth. Plenty of hops at play (80 IBUs), bobbing just below the malt.<br/><br/>Sip, gulp, swallow, and the parade of flavors begins again, dancing along the tongue, like some malefic ballet. Dark fruit sensations rise up and leave the mind searching for the connection. Dark cherries, berries, raspberry? ....but completely covered in a shell of chocolate. The lip smacks, the tongue scrapes up remnants of this rich elixir, not to miss a drop of deliciousness. <br/><br/>To state "full-bodied" would be an act of redundancy. This is huge, long, and out of the ordinary. Ends smooth and dryly, a pleasing finish, still loaded with flavor, never dying away completely. <br/><br/>Puts many a RIS to shame, though I'd love to sit down and do a comparison among others. To the great credit of Darkness, the alcohol content does not really stick out until nearing glasses end, and the less attractive aspect is that the beautiful dark, rich flavor leaves you craving more, ...although you probably shouldn't. (It's 9.5%, give or take.)<br/><br/>I entered the heart of Darkness, and peered into the abyss...found it satisfactory to my soul, and I believe I will take this midnight ride again and again...in moderation...<br/><br/>and to think, there is a bourbon barrel version on it's way...oh, sweet mercy!<br/><br/>Hey, Todd, which metal album should have been thundering in the background while I drink this?<br/>And thank you for brewing this beer, to my knowledge the only Russian Imperial Stout from a Minnesota brewery, outside of the brewpubs.<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">2,549 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/feloniousmonk.1022/">feloniousmonk</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/13014/33127/?ba=feloniousmonk">Oct 30, 2006</a></span></div></div></div></div></div>
