<b>Notes &amp; Commercial Description:</b>
<br/>
Beer added by: xlperro on 01-27-2005<br/><br/>Pliny the Younger, the man, was Pliny the Elder’s nephew and adopted son. They lived nearly 2,000 years ago! Pliny the Elder is our Double IPA, so we felt it was fitting to name our Triple IPA after his son. It is almost a true Triple IPA with triple the amount of hops as a regular I.P.A. That said, it is extremely difficult, time and space consuming, and very expensive to make. And that is why we don’t make it more often! This beer is very full-bodied with tons of hop character in the nose and throughout. It is also deceptively well-balanced and smooth.<!--/sse--></td>

Younger appears a little hazy golden yellow/orange-like color with a white creamy head. Slick amount of lace clings to the glass in a wall at places and legs droopy along other parts. The aroma of this beer has a piercing amount of hops. It is like a frontal assault of awesomeness in the form of scents and smells. Fruity nose of grapefruit, citrus, and a sweetness almost like cotton candy. Taste is a blend of the same malty sweetness reminding me of smooth cotton candy meets a ton of floral-like and super flavorful hops. Partially grassy and spicey and as it warms there are notes of bubblegum that comes out in the nose. For 11% seriously where is the alcohol? The presence of alcohol is noticeable in both warmth and taste but relatively compared it is so minor, smooth and just unlike any other beer I've had at over 10 abv. This beer is so hoppy but it is a flavorful hoppy not just all bitterness. Medium to light feel with a moderate amount of carbonation. This beer is so drinkable, I would love to have more but I am thankful and appreciative that we are limited to one serving. Slightly acidic in the finish with the way it starts to burn the back of the mouth/throat. <br/><br/>This was my second experience with the younger. The first time I had it was a month prior and I refused to take notes and just savor every sip. There is an evident change in this beer from just a month of time passing. However, overall this beer is absolutely awesome and a must try. For the greatest enjoyment and complexity of the experience, it should be enjoyed as fresh as possible.<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">1,797 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/stakem.300923/">stakem</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/863/21690/?ba=stakem">Apr 27, 2010</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="2159" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/weswes.2159/"><img alt="Photo of WesWes" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/2/2159.jpg?1335284334" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.57</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#990000;">-2.1%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5</span><br/><br/>The beer pours a beautiful golden color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is outstanding. It's your typical West Coast DIPA, but done to perfection. It has your standard pale malt base which seems to provide adequate balance. The hop aroma is sublime. It's citrusy with hints of pine. It's very bitter, yet not as much as I thought it would be. The taste is great; so smooth and drinkable. The alcohol is nowhere to be found. What there is , is a damn tasty beer that's relatively light and loaded with hops. This is a thing of beauty. The mouthfeel is great as well. It's a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. The drinkability of this beer is off the charts.

I need to mark this date in my palm pilot as the day I had the best beer ever created by a human.<br/> <br/>Presentation- 12 oz tulip glass poured from the tap.<br/> <br/>Appearance- Nice 1/2-3/4 inch white ultra creamy head. Beautiful cloudy golden pour with excellent lacing.<br/> <br/>Smell- I could not stop smelling this glass. Even when it was empty I would go back and literally try to wedge my nose into the glass. If it were possible this glass would become and appendage from my nose. A very sweet smelling hop presence. Lots of grapefurit and pine, but in a sweet floral manner. Didn't have that astringent bitter make your head fly back scent. This one just glided down with the greatest of ease. <br/> <br/>Taste- This is truly God's elixer. The first thing I thought of was...how soon before I can find this bad boy on the shelves. Then I realized that it's probably not going to be bottled :( So,...how soon until I can get a growler of this stuff. Reminds me of Dogfish 90, but sweeter and with more character. Lots of frutiy and floral hops, but not overporing. Tons of flavor and a sweetness that works perfect..with at least my taste buds. You can detect the alcohol though. I had three beers of 9%, 11% and 6% and I am done for the day. Gimme that water!!!<br/> <br/>Mouthfeel- Light carbonation, plus the sweetness make this super easy to send down the pipe.<br/> <br/>Drinkability- According to the Toronado, this beer is the first triple IPA. I went to their website and they don't even show it as one of their current beers. So, I am going to email them and find out for sure. The bartender originally told me it was 13%, which threw my head back pretty damn quick. All I can tell you is that the first thing I thought of after my first sip was...I am going to buy a kegerator and order a keg of this. It's absolutely incredible. A pure pleasure to drink.<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">1,881 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/gclarkage.8568/">GClarkage</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/863/21690/?ba=GClarkage">Jan 27, 2005</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="213734" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/billab914.213734/"><img alt="Photo of billab914" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/213/213734.jpg?1329998221" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.79</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#006600;">+2.6%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5</span><br/><br/>Thanks to a very generous BA for dealing with the madness at the release and shipping through one of the worst storms DC has ever seen to get this to me. It's been a long weekend of driving up and back to Buffalo and I've been looking forward to opening this growler.<br/><br/>Poured from a growler into my Russian River tulip glass. Pours an amber orange color with a one finger white head. The head settled and clung to the sides of the glass where it left excellent lacing on the sides. <br/><br/>Aroma pretty hoppy with citrus, grapefruit, pineapple and pine all present in the nose. It also has a somewhat sweet aroma to it which I really like. It smells so fresh and delicious, it really showcases the hops better then any other beer I have had.<br/><br/>The taste is just as hoppy as the nose lets on. It has a good amount of pineapple and grapefruit flavors up front with more of a pine finish. There is a sweetness to it that is stronger up front and then is somewhat balanced out by the bitter pine finish. The alcohol is a little present in the finish, and it definitely gives you a warming feeling after a glass. They really do an excellent job on both this one and elder at getting that sweet flavor but also balance it out with the bitterness in the finish. <br/><br/>Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good especially for the abv. It's a very good tasting and smooth drinking beer which makes it very drinkable. It is pretty high in alcohol content and that is quite evident after drinking one glass so there is a definite limit on how much of this I want to drink.<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">1,583 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/billab914.213734/">billab914</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/863/21690/?ba=billab914">Feb 21, 2010</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="1881" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/gavage.1881/"><img alt="Photo of Gavage" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/1/1881.jpg?1329938233" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.57</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#990000;">-2.1%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4</span><br/><br/>Appearance: light orange in color with a short 1/4" head that broke down quickly. No lace devlops.<br/><br/>Smell: grapefruit, loads of hop bitterness, and a hint of sweetness creates a nice aroma.<br/><br/>Taste: big malt profile with a finely balanced sharp bitterness. Loads of grapefruit, caramel, ripe fruit, and a bit of lemon are most dominant. The bitterness does not overwhelm. Alcohol levels are not even noticable.<br/><br/>Mouthfeel: medium-heavy in body. Lightly crisp throughout with dryness late. Aftertaste is long as the flavors linger in the mouth.<br/><br/>Drinkability: this beer went down rather quicky despite the big flavor profile. Is this beer the best in the world ? I still think Westy 12 would be my choice in a heads up competition, but this is one great beer.

Pale brass yellow to bronze amber body. Very clear and crystal, not much noticeable carbonation. Given with only a thin off tan to white soapy collar that never lets up. Very pretty looking IPA, with some matching spider like lacing.<br/><br/>Nose is familiar. A great wet sense of juicy hop orange and tangerine. There's a honey sweetness behind this also, it really reminds me of hopslam, and a very dry heat that come off of it. Not boozy smelling at all. Clean, but doesn't give me the sense of a big body coming.<br/><br/>Palate hits hop front hard. Big juicy but still wet body, not unlike Zombie Dust, but with a quenching almost pilsner crispness. Hop explosive notes of hinted orange from the nose, but the body is far more tropical with giant fruits of mango, maybe peach, but giant fruit punch tropics. Incredibily dry finish, almost getting into brut champagne territory, with pine hop complimenting the arid quality nicely. There is just a touch though, a peck of grainy character on this in the swallow.<br/><br/>It's very memorable, and hardly contains any alcohol boozy heat. I completely forgot this just barely kicks in over ten percent abv, it sure doesn't feel like it at all. It personally for myself is just missing that hint of bigger body, and oomph, and a certain "wow" factor. It's so close but it's a great beer.

Served in a 10oz serving.<br/><br/>A- Pliny The Younger came to me with a bright orange with some gold hints here and there. Holding this glass in my hand the color seemed to bounce on to my skin with the same bright color. Not much in terms of head just some white streaks scattered.<br/><br/>S- A nice mountain of hops that are quite subdued surprisingly. Cirtus scents left and right. A lot of grapefruit and some pine in there as well. Just so much juicy hops that I don't know what else to say. Tropical scents abound. My friend oglmcdgl said it reminded him of a powdered lemon jelly donut.<br/><br/>T- It's been about two years since I had this last and it's still the bomb. The hops work their magic giving off the tropic and floral qualities that they are known to do grapefruit being most dominate. A bit of piney essence as well. Some sticky sweetness presents itself as well. This is kick ass stuff!! <br/><br/>M- A bit thicker than the elder as the younger is pretty much medium bodied. Bittering hops on the tounge but not too much. For 11% alc it is hidden remarkably well with some sweetness coming from the some ingredient. The taste of this hangs around for a bit after drinking.<br/><br/>D- Dangerously drinkable, but at 11% dangerous in it's own right. Younger is limited so i'm glad I tried 20oz or so and will be looking for it again in the next month. After a month, my guess is that younger won't be around for another year or more, so in the meantime i'm enjoying living in SEPA.<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">1,499 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/barflyb.181122/">BARFLYB</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/863/21690/?ba=BARFLYB">Mar 17, 2009</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="164758" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/doublej.164758/"><img alt="Photo of DoubleJ" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/164/164758.jpg?1330393407" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.77</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#006600;">+2.1%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4</span><br/><br/>2009 version. I've had this year's version a couple times, at Beachwood BBQ and Verdugo Bar. The hop aroma is much more pungnet in the nose than I remember, and I can taste a smoother, more balanced beer in this year's version. Some caramel and bready notes emerge alongside with the intense, puckering hops, and it's slightly cleaner too. Overall, I like 2009's version a little more than the 2008 version, and the latter was pretty awesome as well.<br/><br/>2/13/08 (4.5/4.5/5/5/4.5)<br/><br/>I was fortunate to hear this beer would be on tap at Hollingshead's this week. I raced over this afternoon and grabbed a 12 ounce sample, which was poured into a goblet. On to the beer:<br/><br/>The beer glows a deep orange color. Aroma was very hoppy, lots of metallic smelling hops at first, but it mellowed out to be sweeter as it warmed. My first impression on this beer was that it isn't as "intense" as one might think. Extremely smooth and syrupy thick on the palate. All I could think of was hop juice, yet still has a nice balance to it. The long lingering flavor of hops comes to no surprise. <br/><br/>What else? If you find this, savor the flavor, and enjoy!<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">1,133 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/doublej.164758/">DoubleJ</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/863/21690/?ba=DoubleJ">Feb 13, 2009</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="19578" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/mebuzzard.19578/"><img alt="Photo of Mebuzzard" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/19/19578.jpg?1329937488" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">3.75</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#990000;">-19.7%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4</span><br/><br/>Falling rock had this on tap, and I didn't want to miss it. served in small snifter at the half pint volume. <br/>Bright ruby and amber brew, really likes the light and shines like a lantern. Good dense, white, and foamed head. Great lacing after every sip and quick swirls...all the way to the end. <br/>Mild hops aroma, yet complex. The alcohol is well concealed. Some floral and vanilla seem to be present as well.<br/>Balanced taste to it. For as much hops as this thing has, the malt is present just at the beginning and a bit in the end. Smooth and sharp. Not bitter, buy very dry. <br/>Deceiving beer with the abv. Dangerous, but very nice.<br/><br/>Update:<br/>This is my third PyT review, the other two being in 06 and 09.<br/>Falling Rock tapped this tonight and I got in on the first of 3 kegs. <br/><br/>Clear, clean light copper pour. A 1 finger white head foamed up. Lacing was thin, a quick swirl brought about the head again, yet lacing didn't quite stick.<br/>A good blend in the aroma of citrus hops, some butteriness, pine and faint biscuit. <br/>A rather lack luster taste. A soft citrus body develops with thin pine and an aftertaste of malt. But that doesn't last long. The body is thin, the bite is quiet and the balance is easily overlooked. At 11% abv, it is very easy drinking. I'm a bit disappointed in this one this year. Still good, but not world class, imho.<br/>Update the update: 2011 sample. I dunno, the taste just isn't meeting the nose (i've upped the smell score). Doesn't seem as juicy as I remember or expected based on the aroma. The appearance today wasn't all that good...no head...but that was due to the pour<br/>Averaged out the scores above<br/>Update: On tap at Backcountry Pizza in Boulder, Feb 11 2012. This version seems thinner. The nose is softer and less hoppy. Nothing bad about it. The feel is drier without the bite. It just kind of evaporates and leaves the palate quickly.<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">1,870 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/mebuzzard.19578/">Mebuzzard</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/863/21690/?ba=Mebuzzard">Feb 23, 2009</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="277522" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/alieniloquium.277522/"><img alt="Photo of Alieniloquium" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/277/277522.jpg?1330260039" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.27</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#990000;">-8.6%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5</span><br/><br/>A beer I thought I'd never get to try.  64 oz. growler poured into a snifter.<br/><br/>Appearance - Clear orange body with a small white head.

Too drinkable for it's weight, a pint will get you buzzed and only make you want more.<br/><br/>Edit 2/15/10 - Having this beer on-tap, fresh at Hollingshead's at 10:10 am when your taste buds are at their best, I think I really know where I am at with this effort. Upped the taste and drinkablity a bit, lowered the appearance, 4.6 tells you really what I think. This is the new #1. This is truly world class. In the end though I can get a similar experience from PtE and I don't have to fight crowds and lines. The hype machine has truly taken this beer to another level. It's so good, I think I will venture to Beachwood on the 23rd, but in the end, I don't know how pumped I'll be about seeking this beer out in 2011. Pretty much check it out at Beachwood since it's close. But the easy days of PtY are over.<br/><br/>Edit 2/25/11 - Having this year's version, it wasn't anywhere close to last year's, just a solid beer. Dropping the score down since sometimes it's insane, other times just a "good" DIPA.<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">1,818 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/halcyondays.145116/">Halcyondays</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/863/21690/?ba=Halcyondays">Aug 02, 2007</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="112309" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/yourefragile.112309/"><img alt="Photo of yourefragile" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/112/112309.jpg?1329928604" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.92</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#006600;">+5.4%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5</span><br/><br/>I was skeptical of the hype for this beer but cutting to<br/>the chase, it delivers, especially as it warms up a little. Had this on tap first at RR brewpub, then at Toronado, review was from first tasting<br/><br/>A: 4.5: A deep, clear, golden orange color with a thin off white<br/>head that quickly dissipates to a thin ring with moderate lacing<br/>and a little carbonation with small persistent, rising bubbles<br/>S: 5: Damn. Punch in the face. Citrus, pine, floral, everything<br/>hits at once and in balance. I could just keep smelling this beer<br/>T: 5: Perfect, at first while this was a little too cool there wasn't that much bitterness from the hops and instead was just a delicious semi-sweet citrus flavor then as it warms up a little the there is a stronger bitterness up front that never lets go but never quite devastates the palate like Hop 15 or Hopslam. Slight malt, chocolate taste hiding in the finish too. Also as it warms up there is a slight taste of alcohol in the background to remind you of the 11% abv. Basically, this is just too good.<br/>M: Again, near perfect to me, nice medium to thicker body that is very smooth and in the finish remarkably creamy/silky with a moderate level of carbonation. <br/>D: Considering the alcohol and ibu this deserves something higher than a 5. I have not had the Elder yet so I can't compare but of all the Imperial/Double/whatever IPAs I've had this is by far the best and easiest drinking.<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">1,417 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/yourefragile.112309/">yourefragile</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/863/21690/?ba=yourefragile">Feb 06, 2008</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="200890" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/kelp.200890/"><img alt="Photo of Kelp" border="0" height="48" src="styles/default/xenforo/avatars/avatar_male_s.png" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.59</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#990000;">-1.7%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5</span><br/><br/>Received this from sugit.<br/><br/>Pours forth an orangy color.

This is way to easy to drink for the ABV that it is. Hops right off the bat, then citrus follows orange and the grapefruit.

Fortunate to get four 5.5oz servings, and transfered 3 to a decent size tulip glass. My wife insisted on having 1 for herself. This might have been "sharing the love" a bit too far.<br/><br/>Descriptions noted before cover it pretty well. But I am writing this because I expect many who have not tried it may have the same misimpression that I had before tasting.<br/><br/>Having had PTE ...and can't keep track of many, many other excellent IPAs (Imp, double imp, DIPA, etc etc etc)from West Coast and otherwise I was expectig just a bigger/supposedly better beer...what a mistake.<br/><br/>The first impression was so surprising...that the hop profile was excellent; absoltutely delicious, vast ( no surprise)... but no haymaker/slap to the mouth. No jolt, just so full of flavor. The malts were big and very present in taste and mouthfeel, but not distracting or bullish. <br/><br/>Thought it was very good.<br/><br/>Half way through the glass it struck me that this might be the best balance of big hops and big malt that I had ever had. The arome remained so pleasant.<br/><br/>Thought was exceptionally excellent.<br/><br/>Finished glass. So smooth, hops and malts so married, so well. Wow.<br/><br/>But this was an IPA...Here I was expecting a rock concert...and instead I got artistry.<br/><br/>I found it the most drinkable and enjoyable IPA I have had...or at least in so long a time that comparison is moot.<br/><br/>Hope you get a chance to try this special beer.<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">1,534 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/billroth.47795/">BillRoth</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/863/21690/?ba=BillRoth">Apr 03, 2011</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="87185" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/georgiabeer.87185/"><img alt="Photo of Georgiabeer" border="0" height="48" src="styles/default/xenforo/avatars/avatar_male_s.png" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.97</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#006600;">+6.4%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5</span><br/><br/>Thanks very much to Grant for sharing this growler at the Brick Store Pub. I've somehow missed this every year in California even though I'm usually there every time it comes out- sadly I'm usually working too hard then to seek it out or go up to Santa Rosa. I love the Elder, and this beer is every bit as good as I'd hoped. Pours golden with okay head and some excellent lacing. Very nice for a growler. A beautiful blast of pine on the nose with some lovely sweet caramel malt providing a nicely layered backbone underneath. For me, the taste is perfect. Sweet malt and a heavy dose of extremely fresh tasting piney hops that have just oozed their oils into this brew. Some nice citrus on the finish as well that combines with the sweet malt for a nice slightly candied finish to the herbal explosion that came beforehand. Deep flavors that roll on and on. Exquisite. The mouthfeel is at first prickly with hops and then smooth with creamy malt. Looong finish. Utterly delicious. I could drink this all day and pay for it later. Not as dry as the Elder of course, but even more deeply flavored. A masterpiece from my favorite brewery.<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">1,137 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/georgiabeer.87185/">Georgiabeer</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/863/21690/?ba=Georgiabeer">May 04, 2009</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="268461" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/corby112.268461/"><img alt="Photo of corby112" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/268/268461.jpg?1339710060" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.03</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#990000;">-13.7%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4</span><br/><br/>Sampling this live right now at Capone's.<br/><br/>Pours a dark golden orange/tangerine color with golden orange hues when held to a light source and a two finger fluffy, soapy white head that has amazing retention, only slowly fading into a lasting cap. Soapy chunks of white lacing are left behind. <br/><br/>Uber fresh dank oily hop aroma that is very floral with a lot of sweet citrus notes balancing out the earthy pine. Slight malt presence and a somewhat strong alcohol character. The high ABV is noticeable in he nose and takes away from the hops a bit. <br/><br/>Chewy full body, especially for the style, that is bursting with uber fresh earthy piny and sweet citrus hops. Very floral with lots of lemon peel and grapefruit as well as some tropical mango and pineapple. There is a slight malt backbone providing some balance but this beer is all about the hops. There is a good bit of alcohol heat that takes away from the hops a bit too much for my liking but overall the ABV is decently masked. This beer is still dangerously drnkable but I wish that it had a little less heat. I've had this beer several times and I love it but I still prefer Elder.<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">1,138 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/corby112.268461/">corby112</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/863/21690/?ba=corby112">Feb 27, 2010</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="1843" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/weeare138.1843/"><img alt="Photo of weeare138" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/1/1843.jpg?1330458002" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.44</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#990000;">-4.9%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4</span><br/><br/>Much thanks to hopdog for this hand filled bottle...don't know if/when I would ever see it on draft around here.<br/>Appears a light gold with a small off-white head that slowly fades out.

Big abundant hop aromas here. The first thing that hits your nose is a stiff aroma of bitter oranges and Meyer lemons, a very citrus smelling IPA. Lots of pine and spice scents are in this one. Black pepper, lemon grass, cardamom, fennel. Fruit scents of papaya, mango, pineapple and probably others, this stuff numbs up your sense of smell after a while.<br/> <br/>Taste is surprisingly mild at the beginning and is dominated by fruit flavors, peaches, melon and passion fruit at the start. Spicy hops flavors join in next pepper coriander, lemon zest, angostura bitters, and a bit of juniper berry. Quite a tasty beer indeed! <br/> <br/>Mouthfeel is quite good.<br/> <br/>A super tasty beer here that I could almost give straight 5s for but I do think Pliny the Elder and Three Floyds Dreadnaught are just a little better. Having said that I will hit this stuff like a starving Mako Shark anywhere I see it offered. Word Class Beer!

Excellent lacing.<br/><br/>S: Monstrous hop aroma, with big pine notes accompanied by grapefruit, orange, and a little apricot. Bright, vibrant, and exceptional. Booze is really well hidden.<br/><br/>T: Deeply resinous with well masked yet apparent alcohol in the flavor. Malt provides a little backing but no evident taste. Lots of pine and grapefruit. Alcohol is incredibly well hidden for the ABV. Great hop flavor, one of the best in the style. Some orange and grapefruit rind in the moderately bitter finish. Overall, the flavor exhibits massive hop influence with a smooth upper moderate bitterness. Never astringent or harsh.<br/><br/>M: Medium in body with moderate carbonation. Mouthfeel is crisp and sticky. This aspect is amazing. Unlike many other Double IPAs that attempt to approach this ABV, it's never heavy on the palate.<br/><br/>Overall: I love this beer, but I think a few others I've had in the last year are just as good. Regardless, this is world class and it was nice to finally try this year's batch with minimal effort.<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">1,143 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/hophead84.109437/">HopHead84</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/863/21690/?ba=HopHead84">Feb 27, 2011</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="3421" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/john_m.3421/"><img alt="Photo of John_M" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/3/3421.jpg?1330029912" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.97</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#006600;">+6.4%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5</span><br/><br/>On tap at Local 44 and Memphis Taproom in Philly yesterday.<br/><br/>The beer pours a striking golden peach color with good head retention and lacing. On the nose... this beer is just heaven. There is a huge blast of pine and dry bitter citrus, with a hop presence so intense that it imparts almost a slight skunky, marijuana aroma. Have seen this in a few over the top wet hop bombs in the NW, but suffice it to say that such an intense, gorgeous nose is extremely unusual and impressive. The flavors on the palate replicate the nose, except there is an intensity of flavor that is just astonishing. Tried this side by side with the elder - the elder was almost light and watery by comparison!!! The finish just goes on and on in this beer, and there is an underlying creamy smooth mouthfeel to this beer that is, once again, astonishing.<br/><br/>At 11% alcohol, drinkability is of course a problem, but this great beer carries its alcohol very well. Ended up drinking three 10 ounce glasses of this great beer, before I was finally worn out. For a hophead like myself, this beer is a wet dream in a glass. Fabulous stuff!<br/><br/>Edit from 2/11. Was fortunate enough to have several glasses (three if the truth be known) at the brewpub on the release date (friday). Nothing really to add to my review, except to note what an incredible treat it was to have this beer so fresh. Fresh at the site; a couple weeks old in Portland; roughly a month old in SEPA... younger is consistently excellent and delicious.<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">1,487 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/john_m.3421/">John_M</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/863/21690/?ba=John_M">Mar 16, 2009</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="174542" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/barleywinefiend.174542/"><img alt="Photo of barleywinefiend" border="0" height="48" src="styles/default/xenforo/avatars/avatar_male_s.png" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.5</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#990000;">-3.6%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5</span><br/><br/>After tap, now on to the growler courtesy of Grabbin2nd.<br/>Growler popped loud and we all scream YESSS!Poured a nice golden orangish color with great carbonation and nice white head. Nose is pine, grapefruit, booze, perhaps hint of ornage peel. Taste is pine, grapefruit murdering the palate with hops, bittering medium way with floral, citrus and hop oils coming out, caramel and booze being pretty subdued by all the damn flavors.

Love the mouthfeel and drinkability for a IIIPA. But lacking a bit in the aroma this time.<br/><br/><br/>2012 review:<br/><br/>4/4.5/4.5/5/5<br/><br/>At Belmont Station, side-by-side with Elder.<br/><br/>A: Copper, good clarity. Small, but persistent, head<br/><br/>S: Intense piney hops, forest floor earthiness, and something else a little funky in there, maybe a whisper of diaper. Except in a good way? Having a hard time describing it.<br/><br/>T: Huge hops flavor, but not overwhelming bitterness. A somewhat peculiar and almost artificial sweetness gives it backbone.<br/><br/>M: Long finish, slightly drying. Medium-low carbonation, enough to keep it quite drinkable<br/><br/>O: Okay, Younger you win. I take back everything I've said in the past about you not actually being as good as Elder. Maybe my tastes have changed, but I'm enjoying a bit more sweetness and malt-body in my IIPAs these days. Best beer ever, I don't know.

Thanks to Phatz for sharing it.<br/><br/>A: The ale has a vibrant golden color that nicely blends orange and yellow tones. The head has held up nicely, coming in thick and billowy on each pour.<br/><br/>S: The aroma is this thick with big juicy hops. Aromas include grapefruit, apricot and soapiness. The malts are big too, caramelly and big.<br/><br/>T: This IPA is incredible. The hops are thick and powerful from the first sip to the last, providing apricot, pineapple, grapefruit and lemon rind flavors. The malts don't shy away from the hops either. They are big and chewy, full of caramel and biscuit. The strength of the malts is enough to push this into barleywine territory (but that is another argument for another day).<br/><br/>M: The mouthfeel is intense from start to finish, showcasing an incredible array of hops and a big malty profile.<br/><br/>D: If only this beer weren't 11%... The ale is delicious with a great hop profile that refuses to let go of your tastebuds.<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">1,005 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/akorsak.2845/">akorsak</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/863/21690/?ba=akorsak">Feb 25, 2007</a></span></div></div></div></div></div>
