I've been waiting a long time for this one. Heard the hype for months and finally picked one up locally in SoCal. Yeah, imagine that. I bought a can of this in L.A. at retail. 1 pint aluminum can served into a New Belgium stem-goblet in me gaff in Los Feliz, Los Angeles, California. 8.00% confirmed. Consumed in celebration of completing my grad school applications. I don't see canned-on date, but my local beer store guy informed me it was two weeks old when I bought it yesterday. <br/><br/>Served straight from the refrigerator and allowed to warm slightly over the course of consumption. I went back on forth on whether to pour this one into a glass because the label advises me not to. I'm compromising and taking my first sip from the can, but then pouring some of it into a glass and leaving some in the can for later consumption. Side-poured with standard vigor as no carbonation issues are anticipated.<br/><br/>T (Early):On the first sip I get delightful grapefruit and citrus esters, with pale clean malts and lovely floral hopping. Oily hops abound, with hints of pine. Boy, this is going to be interesting. <br/><br/>A: Pours a one finger beige colour head of nice thickness and cream, and decent retention for the high ABV. Body colour is a fairly vibrant burnt orange-auburn. Nontransparent. No yeast particles are visible. No bubble show. Not the best IPA appearance I've seen, but pleasant.<br/><br/>Sm: Grapefruit, pale malts, citrus esters, floral hops, and heavy oily hops - but surprisingly little pine. Quite light in strength, but appealing. <br/><br/>T: Perfectly balanced; never too bitter. Grapefruit zing but not in an overbearing way. Floral hops and heavy hop oils (a component I think is rather unique and special to this beer; I've never experienced it quite like this). Citrus, tropical fruit on the back end. I even get pinapple and mango. Maybe apricot too. Passion fruit? (I'm never sure; I've never had an actual passion fruit). Pale malts a are a perfect complement to the hop choices. No alcohol or yeast comes through. That's tasty stuff. I'm shocked at the lack of bitterness; I don't even remember Pliny The Younger (let alone Elder) mitigating the bitterness this well. There's some (very very little) on the climax, but just enough to add a welcome dimension. Well layered and quite subtle. It doesn't beat you over the head like most beers in the style. No metallic taste despite being from a can. Perfect sweetness to suit its hoppiness. <br/><br/>Mf: Smooth and wet, with perfect crispness and coarseness to coax out the subtler flavours. Fresh, refreshing, and perfectly carbonated. Oily. A bit buttery.<br/><br/>Dr: This is probably the most drinkable IPA (not just Double IPA, but IPA as well) I've ever had the delight to consume. It's refreshing as hell, the 8% is nowhere to be seen, and I imagine it would pair brilliantly with any food. A master class in balance and what an IPA should be. I hate to buy into the beer versus beer debates, but in my book this is clearly better than Pliny The Elder. I expected something different based on the hype, but this surprised me with its balance and sophistication. Wow. This is definitely one of the best beers in the style that I've had. I look forward to trying more beer from the Alchemist and to one day having this on-draught. If you see this, buy it. I'm not a big IPA fan and I'm loving this stuff. Brilliantly built. I could easily down this one all night. If there's a better IPA out there, I have yet to find it. <br/><br/>This beer is nearly perfect in its style. The main thing holding it back is its appearance. <br/><br/>A+ (4.6)  [3 / 3.5 / 4.75 / 4.75 / 4.75]<br/><br/>Serve cold. Drink cold. <br/><br/>Would pair well with anything. Even chocolate.<br/><br/>***<br/>10/01/15: I've had this at least 7 times since my initial review, and significant batch inconsistency has forced me to lower my rating from an A+ to an A-. Some batches have been as low as a High B, whilst some have remained an A or A+. Unfortunate, but true.<br/><br/>A-<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">3,964 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/kojevergas.492136/">kojevergas</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/27039/16814/?ba=kojevergas">Dec 02, 2012</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="304205" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/rifugium.304205/"><img alt="Photo of Rifugium" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/304/304205.jpg?1330109976" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.75</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#006600;">+1.9%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75</span><br/><br/>I've had this enough in a can to be able to appreciate it, but it was nice to have had the opportunity to get it straight from the source and as fresh as possible.<br/><br/>Poured a very cloudy, gold-peach-yellow color with a healthy puff of white head; nice retention and lacing. No worries about floaters on tap. As in the can, big aroma of hops, lemons, and an afterthought of pine needles. Taste is equally laden with juicy hop goodness, lemon, grapefruit, more lemon, pith and pleasant bitterness, light notes of pine and pineapple. Medium body, juicy and fresh up front, crisp and drying in the finish; excellent beer as always. <br/><br/>The Cannery makes for a nice easy diversion and is a quick jaunt from Burlington. Since we can't review breweries here for whatever reason, I'll just quickly note that they have a nice simple set-up, plenty of cans for purchase, sample-sized pours on tap, and lots of neat merch, as well as a self-guided tour.

Looks great in a glass took sip from the can but didn't think it would do the beer justice after that first sip. <br/><br/>Pours into a chalice with a semi hazed golden peach/apricot hue with a bright white head, forms nice even layered lacing down the sides of my glass. I love the can the label the huge paragraph on the back, but the DRINK FROM THE CAN! I just can't figure it out. <br/><br/>Aromatics, beautifully dank hop explosion from the minute you crack the can. Resinous hop oils, dank Mary Jane, lemon pith, slightly vegetal even dare I say garlic note in the tail end of the nose. <br/><br/>Flavor has the perfect light malt base to provided biscuit bready notes without ever touching into the caramelized sugar realms, leaving each sip of this stuff right into an assault of hop character with a bone dry finish. I would honestly brush my teeth with this stuff, it's so good. No hype train here, a highly drinkable completely unique DIPA. Is it the best DIPA I've ever tasted? Certainly not but it's Fuckin' Good!!! A really resinous complex hop explosion on the palate remaining quite balanced and extremely effortless to consume. I would be dangerous if I had access to affordable cases of this stuff. The highlighted hop notes are as follows: dank hop resins, lemon pith, pine, and that vegetal garlic note I picked up on the nares. Usually offended by that trait in a hop profile, that's not the case here. <br/><br/>Mouthfeel is perfect, like I said way to easy to consume this stuff. Oily slick with those hop resins, medium bodied carbonation is soft and caresses the palate, bitter drying hop bitterness finishes each sip...with hop burps soon to follow. <br/><br/>Overall, I really really like this DIPA I can't explain why but I do. I'm willing to make a pilgrimage at some point, also to checkout fine beers like Lawson's, and Hill Farmstead both of which I've never consumed. Not earth shattering but so unique there's just no other canned/bottled/draft DIPAs with these traits they built they're brewery around this recipe and I can see why. No let's see more innovation and how about some distribution outside of Vermont.<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">2,321 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/wvbeergeek.775/">WVbeergeek</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/27039/16814/?ba=WVbeergeek">Jun 14, 2014</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="4440" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/smcolw.4440/"><img alt="Photo of smcolw" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/4/4440.jpg?1420405798" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">3.83</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#990000;">-17.8%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4</span><br/><br/>Sorry, I had to pour into the glass despite the can's pleading to drink directly.

Ale. Alc. 8% by Vol.,1 pint.<br/><br/>"Heady Topper is an American Double India Pale Ale. This beer is not intended to be the biggest of most bitter. It is meant to give you wave after wave of hoppy goodness on your palate. Tremendous amounts of American hops will creep up on you, and leave you with a dense hoppy finish in your mouth. So drinkable, it scary. <br/>Sometime I wish I could crawl right into the can. Fresh ness and control have always been my main concern when it comes to our beer. We are committed to providing you with an unfiltered and unpasteurized hop experience. Why do I recommend that you drink it from the can? Quite simply, to ensure a delightful, hop experience. The act of pouring it into a glass smells nice, but it releases the essential hop aromas that we have worked so hard to retain. If you MUST pour it into a glass, you may find that some of the hop resins have settled to the bottom --leave them in the can when pouring. This beer is perishable, and at it's best when young, fresh, and hazy. Keep it cold but not ice cold. Drink this beer immediately we are always making more. --John Kimmich, The Alchemist, Waterbury, Vermont."<br/><br/>Bullcrap, it's going into a glass, because I MUST. <br/><br/>It's a hazy one, a deep orange/apricot color, not bright, not golden, but clearly it's own thing. It is what it is. The head is a gigantic, prodigious, brogdignagian thing, mushroom capped, blooming with chalk white froth, lace-leaving and slow to leave. Gorgeous look on it.<br/><br/>Aroma: funky, musty, wicked, and weird. I'm at a loss. Thinking about Belgian yeast, thinking about putting a mare to bed. And then the typical hop aromatics creep out, some orange, some mango, grapefruit. None too bitter, either, not too brash, bold or out of control. Juuust right. A delight for the nose.<br/><br/>Taste: Jumps on the tongue and spills out brilliant hoppy flavor. Tingles the tongue in all right ways. Trickles over the palate, leaving happy hop deliciousness everywhere. …"from the can!"…not as complex, not as …gosh, is there a difference? or are we fooling ourselves? From the can, you get the hop blast, you get the flavor, you get the buzz, it's creamy and palatable…but you don't get everything. It's like having sex with a sock on your man, it's just not bringing it all home, if you know what I mean. I wonder why The Alchemist wants to cover this beer up, hide it in a can? Are they trying to elude the look of the brew, do they think people will dislike the chaos and disarray, the multitude of floating particles, as if it's unnatural and ugly? <br/><br/>Full-bodied, long bitter finish. Really tasty, very satisfying and delicious. Best IPA of all?

Had on tap at the Alchemist on my trip up to Vermont. Review number 600!<br/><br/>a - Pours a golden color with one inch of white head and moderate carbonation evident.<br/><br/>s - Smells very heavily of pine hops; very dominating. Also smells of citrus hops, grape fruit, tropical fruit, and faint, sweet fruity malts. Hint of floral hops. A very nice mix of pine and fruit in the smell.<br/><br/>t - Tastes of citrus and grapefruit, fruity malts, pine hops,and a hint of floral hops. Some nice bitterness in the initial sips that fades as you drink it.<br/><br/>m - Medium body and moderate carbonation, very easy to drink.<br/><br/>d - Overall, I thought this was a great DIPA. I was a little worried it wouldn't live up to the hype, but it pretty much did. Personally I think I might rank HopSlam and PTE a bit higher, but this is a great IPA I would love to have again. I got a lot of pine in the smell and a nice mix of fruit and pine in the smell and taste, and I thought it was really easy to drink at 8% ABV. If I was up in Vermont again, I would definitely go back to the Alchemist for this beer.<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">1,088 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/mdfb79.414386/">mdfb79</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/27039/16814/?ba=mdfb79">Sep 03, 2010</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="113604" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/masterski.113604/"><img alt="Photo of MasterSki" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/113/113604.jpg?1329933249" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.69</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#006600;">+0.6%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5</span><br/><br/>Thanks to both SneezyAchew and stowehop for bottles. Served in a Sam Adams perfect pint glass. Bottled 11/30/10, and consumed on 12/09/10.<br/><br/>A - Pours with a finger-plus of off-white foam that features great retention and glass-coating lace. Slightly hazed golden peach body.<br/><br/>S - Huge tropical fruits, peaces, tangerine zest, dankness, a touch of chive or green onion, and a light sugary note that reveals that there is a bit of malt in there somewhere after all.<br/><br/>T - The taste isn't quite as amazing as the smell, although it's still quite good. A bit more malt presence contributes sugared citrus mixed with tropical fruits, and maybe a faint hint of pine and leafiness. It finishes with present but well-attenuated bitterness, although it mounts over time.<br/><br/>M - Carbonation is spot on - lively, but not enough to be harsh. Smooth medium body that is more than adequate for 8%. Goes down very smooth and easy, with a slightly dry finish. Alcohol is extremely well-hidden.<br/><br/>D - This beer is beyond drinkable. I'm looking forward to getting to my other bottles because this is going to make for a great Christmas. Thanks John, for finally caving to the pressure and making this available to all (or at least some).

Can poured into a standard pint.<br/><br/>A - Pours slightly hazed amber orange with a small half finger tall white head leaving small wisps of lace down the glass. It does have a little sediment floating around in there.<br/><br/>S - Smells of pungent grassy hops, rich tropical fruits; mostly mango and grapefruit; and some lightly toasted caramel malt. Still quite floral.<br/><br/>T - The taste is fairly similar to the nose. It starts off with a big dose of grassy hops quickly giving way to a mix of tropical fruits and sweet caramel malts. Fairly tropical flavor that is very easy to drink. The finish is a mix of light dryness and hop bitterness, lingering on the pallet for a short period of time.<br/><br/>M - Medium body and flavor with moderately low carbonation. Smooth, hoopy, feel with plenty of hop bitterness lingering through the finish.<br/><br/>O - Very nice IPA. I had no problem finishing my glass and I was left wanting more.

This IPA has gotten so much buzz in the past year, it quickly became my biggest beer ambition to get some, after having some of the bottle last night, it remains one of my biggest wants. I have to make it up to the alchemist the next time this is on tap.<br/><br/>Beer is yellow to amber with some haziness to it. Head is soft, white, and thin made up of a very small bubbles and some medium ones that stick to the glass leaving a little lacing. Carbonation is moderate to low, it looks good, looks like a hazy IPA.<br/><br/>The aroma is beautiful, absolutely wonderful. No alcohol or heat, minimal malt sweetness, complex mixture of tropical fruits like pineapple and mango, with citrus layers of lime and orange. It smells wonderful.<br/><br/>Beer is light in body and quite carbonated in the mouth. Interesting, probably due to the carbonation, the first thing I notice in this beer is the hop profile. A floral and fruity explosion of hop flavors, again tropical fruits and some citrus that gives way in the late palate to some moderate bitterness. I think they could have gotten away with more bitterness but overall it is a truly amazing IPA.

The smell of this beer makes me want to drink it, and want more and more of it.<br/><br/>T: Just like the smell, the taste of this beer is completely dominated by the hops.

An early pour is relatively hazy while the last dregs contain flocculants that reintroduce themselves into suspension. <br/><br/>The smell is glorious! A cornucopia of hops produce notes of pine resin, fresh basil, ruby red grapefruit sweetened with sugar, wet grass (the kind you smoke;) and candied orange zest.<br/><br/>The taste is in your face fresh, fresh hops. A remarkable combination of all the scents, with a fantastic paradoxical blend of slight candied sweetness and a long dry finish. This is one clean beer with no trace of alcohol whatsoever.<br/><br/>Mouthfeel is perfect. Low to moderate carbonation fits this beer to a T. A creamy lush softness again shows the chameleon-like aspects of this top-notch DIPA. <br/><br/>This beer is exceptional and very deserving of the accolades that have come it's way so far.

A nice retention ring is left behind, along with sticky lace on the walls. Unfiltered floaties are unmistakable in the body, as mentioned there might be should you pour this out. Really, they're just ugly and kill the looks of the beer. I can't help but think this is part of the reason they recommend drinking from the can (other than the hop aroma retention).<br/><br/>S: Piney and earthy hop notes rocket from the glass. Hop resin and oils, orange and lemon bitter peels are next. Towards the end is a crisp bready element and caramel &amp; pale malts. Touches of bitterness dance around the entire nose.<br/><br/>T: Bitter hop resin and oils wrestle the palate with a gentle nature. Pine and earthy hop notes again come through. Mid-palate are sweet orange and pink grapefruit oils, a generic citrus and rich sweet caramel malts. Finishes sticky and bitter.<br/><br/>M: Bubbly and creamy, perhaps a bit thin for a medium-bodied beer, though. Sticky bitter pine and sap on the palate in the linger.<br/><br/>This is easily in the top five Imperial IPAs I've ever had to date.

Much appreciated Jeff. Poured from a pint sized can into a tulip. This brew appears a hazed copper color. Very fine particulate is stuck throughout the suspension of this brew keeping it from being clear. A solid finger of creamy off-white head sits atop this brew and hold with very solid retaining powers. As the cap slowly fades, it completely coats the entire wall of the glass with an entire wall of lace.<br/><br/>The smell of this brew is very fruited and so much so that it is unlike the typical fruit aromas imparted by hops. It is quite tropical smelling primarily of pineapple with a light touch of mango. Some very light leafy to grassy hop inclusion is present across the back but this is all about the fruity sweetness of the hops here. A very light tingle of alcohol helps to accented the fruited quality of this brew.<br/><br/>The taste of this brew is pretty darn fantastic. The fruit aromas that the hops display in the nose completely transpose themselves in the flavor of this beer. This brew is littered with tropical hop flavoring tasting of pineapple, passion fruit, mango and agave. There is a very mild herbal bitter flavoring that keeps things in check and almost a minty aspect is thrown in there as well. The alcohol is very well hidden initially but starts to make itself known with a warmth and a bit of solvent kick once the brew comes up to temperature. The aftertaste is a bit herbal and lightly grassy which is a nice contrast to the sweetness throughout the brew. There is a perfect amount of toasted malt character present in this brew to hold the hops in place. Fantastic stuff right here.<br/><br/>This is a medium bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. All in all this is the perfect package. The hop inclusion is bright, fresh and fruity. The alcohol is seemingly nonexistent until it comes up to temperature. The flavors of this brew run the full spectrum of hop characteristics. I killed a pint of this brew effortlessly. As far as drinkability goes, this is perfect and dangerously so. The label boasts that this should be drank from the can but I just cant do that. To not be able to sit and sniff this brew is a crime. I had this when it was first released from a bottle and thought this beer was all hype. Sitting here enjoying a can by myself I an throughly impressed. Fantastic stuff here Alchemist!<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">2,413 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/stakem.300923/">stakem</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/27039/16814/?ba=stakem">Sep 17, 2011</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="168653" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/huhzubendah.168653/"><img alt="Photo of Huhzubendah" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/168/168653.jpg?1330063255" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">5</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#006600;">+7.3%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5</span><br/><br/>Bottle shared by Thorpe429. Thanks Mike!<br/><br/>A: This DIPA appears noticeably hazier than other brews of this ilk. The beer itself is light orange in color, with a 1/4" head that leaves a fair amount of lacing. <br/><br/>S: Wow! The aroma is simply amazing. A bouquet of fresh tropical fruits, to include pineapple, mango, grapefruit, guava. No alcohol or malt scents to be found, just as it should be.<br/><br/>T: Wonderfully hop forward and delicious. The taste is fantastic, but not quite as unbelievable as the aroma, which was absolutely world class. The flavor is all about hops, citrus / tropical fruits, and floral notes. Terrific beer.<br/><br/>M: Bitter and dry, in the best possible way. Hop and fruit flavors linger on the palate between drinks.<br/><br/>D: I have wanted to try this beer for a long time. It is absolutely worthy of all the praise it has received. I look forward to drinking some on draft the next time I visit the lovely state of Vermont.<br/><br/>Edit: Drank over a case of this over the summer. Simply phenomenal beer. I'm not sure how or where this beer could improve. One of the best beers I have had. Dangerously drinkable and mouth wateringly delicious.

My gentle Glug still produced a finger of fizzy, bone-white head that turned to wisps pretty quickly. Color was a hazy Golden-Amber (SRM = &gt; 5, <br/>Unbelievable! 537 CAN reviews with my CANQuest (TM) entry as # 538. I CANnot remember any other craft CANs with this many reviews! Impressive.<br/><br/>From the CAN: "DRINK FROM THE CAN! [x3 for added emphasis]"; "Heady Topper is an Ameri[CAN] Double India Pale Ale. This beer is not intended to be the biggest or most bitter. It is meant to give you wave after wave of hoppy goodness on your palate. Tremendous amounts of Ameri[CAN] hops will creep up on you and leave you with a dense hoppy finish in your mouth. So drinkable, it's scary. Sometimes I wish I could crawl right into the [CAN]. Freshness and control have always been my main concern[s] when it comes to our beer. We are committed to providing you with an unfiltered and unpasteurized hop experience. Why do I recommend that you drink it from the [CAN]? Quite simply, to ensure a delightful, [sic] hop experience. The act of pouring it in a glass smells nice, but it releases the essential hop aromas that we have worked so hard to retain. If you MUST pour it into a glass, you may find that some of the hop resins have settled to the bottom - leave them in the CAN when pouring. This beer is perishable, and at its best when it is young, fresh and hazy. Keep it cold, but not ice cold. Drink this beer immediately, we are always making more. [Undersigned] John Kimmich, The Alchemist, Waterbury, Vermont"; "Don't be a D-Bag, recycle this [CAN]!".<br/><br/>My apologies to Mr. Kimmich, but a basic tenet of The CANQuest (TM) is to deCANt the beer into a glass. I do not tell him how to do his job, I would appreciate if he did not tell me how to do mine. I hear from too many people that "CANned beer tastes metallic", mostly because they are French Kissing the goldanged CAN. I may pour some and drink some from the CAN, but how CAN I review it without seeing it in all of its glory, which is another tenet for inclusion in The CANQuest - review only, no "Hads". The last tenet is to drink it all, no matter how vile. This is to separate the men from the boys, hear me, Minhas?!?<br/><br/>At last, after all of that transcription, it is Crack &amp; Glug time! Anticipation, it's makin' me wait! Man, but Carly Simon was a babe in her prime. Still in all, I would not kick her out of bed for eating crackers in the sack, even today. It's like I was telling the young honey honey the other day, we all age and if you think you will be the hardbody you are now in twenty-five years, you got another think comin'. But I digress, as I am often wont to do.<br/><br/>Wow, but the room smelled dank! I had just under two fingers of dense tawny head that was creating the kind of lacing that would require a jackhammer to remove as it fell. The amber liquid was hazy, dense, viscous and I wanted to dive into it just to see where it would lead. Nose was resinous, if that adjective may be applied to a liquid. Pine, wintergreen, menthol, green, baby! Holy overwhelming, Batman! Mouthfeel was sticky and in the way that napalm was sticky. Man, you get that burning craziness on your skin and you start running down the road stark naked. Phan Thi Kim Phuc, I feel your pain. I suddenly got the urge to strip down and run up the street with my tongue lolling out of my mouth in the hopes of some cooling action. It is a good thing that people are used to this sort of thing from me or there might have been real trouble. I'm back and to great applause as the late-1960's and early-1970's are making a comeback and streaking is again fashionable. This is some groovy weed, I mean, beer. Finish was so gaspingly dry that I am reaching for my asthma inhaler. Let's do this again, real soon. No, really, man, how soon CAN I score some more? I mean, you're always growing, I mean, making more, right?<br/><br/>Now directly from the CAN: Oh yeah, it's an epiphany! I CAN rap with my late Pops while going bowling with Jesus. Dude, you CANnot pick up the 7-10 split to save your life, CAN you? That, and now I got this metallic taste going on that was not present before. Wow, baby, wow! Groovy. <br/><br/>Hey, dig this, hep cats, this is what'll send you (and I don't mean via FedEx, in fact, the less the feds are involved, the better). Stamp help out. Lenny Bruce is not afraid.

Evaluated by pouring straight down the middle very slowly into a nonic pint glass, letting the head settle, then topping up later. At first about 4 oz was only poured in the nonic pint glass, with the can to be evaluated afterwards.<br/><br/>Nice looking can. As for the beer, really exceptional looking slowly decanting the beer punching it through the center of the glass. Head on the bottom forms the most perfect looking microscopic nitro looking bubbles, with the top filled with creamy off white foam. Body color is textbook almost pale amber with great orange hues. Slightly hazy guessing unfiltered but just enough to see through it. Head retention is massive, you couldn't drive a mac truck through this and it hangs for a long time. <br/><br/>Ripping this open, man the hops just escape. Smelling the can a real dry hop pine sense, and of course my lip hits the bottom and I taste aluminum. However, when pouring about five ounces, the nose brings a giant hop pine which is tolerable and not aggressive. Small malt and tiny sugars, dry hop smelling hops and pine but also a real burnt smelling and sense of smoke. Very unique.<br/><br/>Tasting out of the glass, a surprising turn. Citrus angle hits first of a smooth orange, finish resin pine comes creeping in with a slow calm bitterness. The citrus angle is quite a surprise from the nose. Tasting from the can the beer is more prickly and carbonated, but nowhere as good or enjoyable. Even a second whiff brings... nothing from the can. Aftertaste just lingers on and on and on. Feel is almost creamy matching the head appearance, lightly carbonated, with a good hint of malt balance. There is also no sense of alcohol booze on this whatsoever.<br/><br/>Overall a great example of the style and real enjoyable, too bad my chances of trying this again are going to be slim in this area. Except when I head to Vermont!

Excited to see this in Philly. I bought it with ease. Purchased a single at Capone's and a 4-pack from the bottle shop at Local 44. Props to Origlio for pulling in a great brewery, it's about time you guys found some new blood.<br/><br/>A silver can, the liquid dispersed in the pint shows a golden orange glaze that haze some hazy within the liquid. Floating particles seen throughout suspended. Not much of a head or even a cap, just a small white ring around the collar.<br/><br/>Smell is pretty bold with a lot of citrus and high dry hopping scent. The funny thing is there is a weird scent that I cant describe that's either a distinct hop variety (im thinking summit) or a odd malt type. Kinda reminds me of the Ephraim scent. The scent while not my thing, is lingering.<br/><br/>Taste on the other hand is right up there with the big boys. Out of the CAN, the finish is a bit crisper, while the glass version comes off smother. Either way, a whole lot of dry hopping with citrus, grapefruit, mango, with a sharp pine taste as well. Bitter, but not over the top. Some grassy taste lingers on the tounge with warming.<br/><br/>Feel is pretty much medium, but it really drinks easy as hell, goes down without a burn and not a alarming overly bitter aftertaste. Carbonation is there and not overly done. After the CAN was done, my mouth is not attacked and wrecked, this is the sign of a great DIPA, one that you can drink a few of.

But the uneven haze and murkiness just don't look appealing. The absence of a nice fluffy white head makes it worse. Lacing is splotchy<br/><br/>From there things look up. A nice mango, citrus, grapefruit pairing of hops in the nose. Not all that juicy as some dIPAs, but certainly above average. Light biscuit malt<br/><br/>As this one warms it gets a bit buttery, although butter isn't quite the right term. Pithy? Not sure, but the sharpness of the hop flavors (citrus, grapefruit, pomelo) loses a bit after a short while. The biscuit becomes doughy. Still, the flavors are really enjoyable and quenching. <br/><br/>Feel is dry and sparkly.
