Poured from a 33cl bottle into a tulip glass.<br/><br/>A: The beer is a dark brown color, with a large off-white head that fades very slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass.<br/><br/>S: The aroma is of brown sugar, caramelized malts, Belgian yeast some fruit and a faint touch of hops.<br/><br/>T: The taste starts out sweet with flavors brown sugar, caramel and dark fruit. There's a hearty malt character and Belgian yeast backbone that come in to provide a good deal of substance. The hops presence is very mild but is enough to provide a good balance. The after-taste is sweet.<br/><br/>M: Crisp and very smooth, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is slightly sticky but clean for the style.<br/><br/>D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, deceptively strong kick, very good representation of style, as it is ranked #1 on BA at the time of this review and has been for some time, I was expecting something a bit more demonstrative from this beer, but the only things that stood out in this beer above other were its sweetness and its smoothness. While I don't consider it the absolute best beer on Earth, it is indeed very good.<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">1,210 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/themaniacalone.37950/">TheManiacalOne</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/313/1545/?ba=TheManiacalOne">Oct 15, 2009</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="102045" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/slatetank.102045/"><img alt="Photo of Slatetank" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/102/102045.jpg?1443628021" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.85</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#006600;">+5.2%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5</span><br/><br/>Thanks to mac300 for sharing this at Phatz' tasting.<br/>A - A beautiful dark ale w/ compact bubbles and light tan head <br/> <br/>S - Roasty, spicy and sweet with scents of currants and dark sugar.<br/> <br/>M - Mellow, sweet and spiced. Layered and balanced with a subtle feel of alcohol and lightly nutty finish.<br/> <br/>T - A malty supple masterpiece. So much flavor figs, nutmeg, gentle herbal notes. So layered and yet the flavors blend seamlessly. Nuts, toffee and honey with a tinge of spice and light grain flavors.<br/> <br/>D - A great nuanced ale - lives up to the hype.<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">553 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/slatetank.102045/">Slatetank</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/313/1545/?ba=Slatetank">Aug 14, 2007</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="3" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/jason.3/"><img alt="Photo of Jason" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/0/3.jpg?1341282914" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.25</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#990000;">-7.8%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5</span><br/><br/>Presentation: 11.2 oz slender brown bottle, no freshness code and no label.<br/><br/>Appearance: Silky looking off white lace, very tiny bubble dropping rings around the glass.<br/><br/>Smell: Very aromatic. Suggestions of plump golden raisins, anise, herbal tea, buckwheat honey, caramel, lemon rind, fresh baked short bread and a mild phenolic character. Sweet and spicy alcohol in the nose with a mellow malt.<br/><br/>Taste: Luscious velvety mouth feel, medium carbonation that fuels the viscosity of the smoothness and body. Big maltiness is pushed around by a flailing spicy character, bit of clove with a mellow medicinal phenol also. Malt is sweet and has flavours of brown bread and caramel but Christmas pudding also with alcohol and candied fruit. Alcohol is very prevalent but not overwhelming, adds a sweet and spicy presence and a warming effect. Hints of raw honey, anise and lemon zest. Touch of yeast adds the element of earth to the complex mix, esters grow more towards the end with an addition of ghost like fusel alcohol. Semi-dry finish with lingering spicy and phenolic flavours.<br/><br/>Notes: So damn smooth, near perfection in a bottle. The alcohol at its strength does not bring down the drinkability and makes this beer so balanced in a heavenly way that it is devious for making you want more and more.<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">1,300 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/jason.3/">Jason</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/313/1545/?ba=Jason">Mar 16, 2002</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="492136" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/kojevergas.492136/"><img alt="Photo of kojevergas" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/492/492136.jpg?1355091884" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.78</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#006600;">+3.7%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5</span><br/><br/>I had the esteemed pleasure of having this beer on my trip to Belgium; first a one year old version at me mate's house in Ghent, then straight out of the bottle at the abbey when I picked up 48 bottles of blond, then a two year old version at me mate's house. While having the two year old, me mate brought out yet another bottle of the one year old so we could compare them. I figured aged beers were for snobby pretentious little bastards, but I was proven wrong upon tasting the difference betwixt the two. Touche. I didn't actually review the version straight from the abbey, but I've included my reviews of both the one year old and the two year old below. I know I'm a lucky bastard, for the record. Obviously, both were from the bottle, served into a proper Westy goblet. I tasted the aged versions in Ghent, but I don't recall the altitude there. Note the two year aged review is less specific because I knew I'd already reviewed the one year. <br/><br/>A(1yr): Two finger head of amazing cream and thickness. A dark black colour with an amber bottom. Very appealing. Excellent retention. I let the beer sit for a bit so that it would be the correct temperature; it was fetched from a refrigerator. <br/><br/>A(2yr): Two finger head of lovely cream and thickness. Dark amber colour. <br/><br/>Sm(1yr): Cream. Very subtle spices and esters. Esters are seemingly dominated by raspberry. Some nutty hops. Exquisitely subtle. Balanced. A light strength scent overall, but then me nose is broken. <br/><br/>Sm(2yr): Dark fruit. Cream. Hops. Complex. <br/><br/>T(1yr): Beautiful body of nut, spice, and especially tamed fruit, which bleeds - nay - allows itself into the finish. Perfectly balanced. Fruit hangs on the finish, joined by a symphony of cream. Cream is also present on the open. A perfect injection of bitterness is present just before the climax. <br/><br/>T(2yr): Dark fruit, hoppy body build. Amazing. Incredibly complex. Balanced perfectly. Built perfectly. Fuck me that's delightful. <br/><br/>Mf(1yr): Perfectly creamy, smooth, and wet yet dry. Teases an orgasm from the tongue. Amazing. <br/><br/>Mf(2yr): Silky. Soft and smooth. Amazing. Delicate and incredible. <br/><br/>Dr(1yr): I would down this repeatedly if given the chance and budget (and I did, at In Da Vrede). If you have a last meal, this ought to be a candidate for the drink. Makes you close your eyes to savour the taste. Believe the hype; this is the best beer I've had so far. The best retention I've ever seen. <br/><br/>Dr(2yr): Fecking brilliant-like.

I've heard mixed reports on this beer, and from my experience, many true beer aficionados out in the "real world" will tell you, that the main appeal of this beer is it's unavailability, not it's features, and that in fact, a fine Rochefort or even St. Bernardus is as good as or even better than a Westvleteren. So in the end, it's just a matter of opinion, like anything else.<br/><br/>That said, this was a great beer. I acquired the bottle legitimately: a friend of a friend of mine traveled to Westvleteren and respectfully procured me a few bottles from the elusive monks.<br/><br/>My at-the-time fianceé and I each had a bottle, we shared one with friends at our engagement party, I used one for a video review, and I have four that I'm cellaring, with one or two perhaps for trade.<br/><br/>Anyway, on to the review, as you can see from the video, this beer was properly poured into a signature Westvleteren goblet. Dark caramelized brown in color, hazy, moderately carbonated, with a beautifully crafted light tan head that settled right around the "Trappist" logo of the glass, retained throughout the session, and exhibited some fine lacing. Robust aroma, dark fruits, dark sugars. Extremely full of flavor, smooth, candi sugars, toffee, dark cherries, raisins, alcohol is noticeable but not at all detrimental. Earthy, organic, chewy, complex... Medium mouthfeel, but full of flavor, slightly bitter aftertaste, and very drinkable.<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">1,575 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/rifugium.304205/">Rifugium</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/313/1545/?ba=Rifugium">Jun 28, 2011</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="93332" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/rblwthacoz.93332/"><img alt="Photo of RblWthACoz" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/93/93332.jpg?1429668864" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.25</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#990000;">-7.8%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4</span><br/><br/>Hey it's 5:00 on a Saturday.

Carbonation is middle of the road. I like this, yes. It's good. But I feel like this is a bit tight and might need more age to develop more noticeable complexities.

The vinous tone is the hallmark characteristic the one that stands out just a great experience even if it costs 10 to 12 dollars a bottle.

Cap is dated 29.03.09, so it is about 4.5 years old. I've had Westy 12 3 times before this, but always relatively fresh and never more than 2 oz.'s or so, so excited to have a full bottle.<br/><br/>a - Pours a dark mahogany brown color with two to three inches of off white head that lasts for four or five minutes. High carbonation evident and a tiny amount of sediment. Left the last oz. or so in the bottle as the amount of sediment was very high in the bottle.<br/><br/>s - Smells of dark fruits, especially cherries, plums and raisins, as well as Belgian yeast. Also getting some grapes/wine smell in it as well. Hints of caramel malts, sweet fruit malts, spices, bready malts, and a touch of alcohol. Very enjoyable; it's very complex and balanced, especially as it warms up and the cherries come out.<br/><br/>t - Tastes of raisins, plums, figs, other dark fruit, bready malts, caramel malts, Belgian yeast, and a hint of spice. Not really getting any alcohol in the taste. Was hoping for more cherries like the smell, but still wonderful. Tasting amazing.<br/><br/>m - Medium body and high carbonation that stings the tongue. It has a nice, smooth body, but the high carbonation hurt it a bit and keeps it from being great.<br/><br/>d - There's a reason it's #1 of BA; it's pretty amazing. While it isn't the #1 beer on my list, it's safe to say it's high on my list. The good news is that the taste and smell are the highlights of this beer. Both are complex and enjoyable. While the high carbonation hurt the mouthfeel a bit, the smell and taste are amazing. It also definitely helps to let this one warm up a bit, so you can fully appreciate everything in the nose and mouth. If you like quads, I think it is safe to say you'll love this beer. I was also surprised how easy it was to drink and how little alcohol was noticable in the taste. I think I like this slightly better than Westy 8, but it's close. I look forward to aging my other 2 bottles and see how they do with even more time on them.<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">2,017 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/mdfb79.414386/">mdfb79</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/313/1545/?ba=mdfb79">Oct 10, 2010</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="113604" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/masterski.113604/"><img alt="Photo of MasterSki" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/113/113604.jpg?1329933249" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.58</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#990000;">-0.7%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5</span><br/><br/>Review #600. Bottle brought back from Belgium by my wife - thanks Bryna! Served in a Westvleteren goblet. Best before February 10th, 2011, so roughly two years old.<br/><br/>A - Thank god! After the flat bottle I had in Toronto I was worried. The cap comes off with a hiss and a touch of gunsmoke. Pours with a voluminous two fingers of dark tan foam (impressive for a goblet!), that dissipates quite slowly and leaves glass-coating lacing and a thick cap. The body is a nearly opaque dark plum color.<br/><br/>S - The smell literally explodes out of the glass, with an initial wave of dark fruits and berries. Plums, prunes, raisins, black cherries - they're all here. There's some vinous red wine notes that emerge, along with a touch of sweet tobacco, apples, and nuts. There's a caramel malt backbone that ties things together, but stays in the periphery. As it warms a touch of booze peeks through to remind you that this is for sipping.<br/><br/>T - The taste is very grape-forward, with notes of port, red wine, dark fruits, rum-cake, and caramel. It's not as saccharine as Rochefort 10, as it's balanced by a dryish and slightly woody finish. While the taste isn't quite as complex as the nose, the alcohol is better hidden.<br/><br/>M - The body is chewy and viscous, without becoming heavy or syrupy. Carbonation is present, but soft. Finishes surprisingly dry with only mild residual stickiness. Not much in the way of alcohol heat at all. It's everything I'd want in a quad, and maybe even a bit more.<br/><br/>D - So, is it the best beer in the world? Probably not, but it's a superb one nonetheless. It's shockingly drinkable for a 10.2% quad, and I could actually have more than one of these without feeling diabetic too. There's been a lot written about this beer, and I'm not sure there's much I can add - it's excellent, highly recommended, and worthy of the acclaim that has been heaped upon it.<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">1,874 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/masterski.113604/">MasterSki</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/313/1545/?ba=MasterSki">Feb 27, 2010</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="401018" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/orangesol.401018/"><img alt="Photo of orangesol" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/401/401018.jpg?1405025231" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.62</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#006600;">+0.2%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5</span><br/><br/>THE beer. Finally got another one in a recent trade. I decided to open it with a friend of mine and tonight just happened to be that night. Bottle poured into a chalice.<br/><br/>A - Pours murky brown with a start white one and a half finger head leaving small wisps of lacing down the glass.<br/><br/>S - Smells of dark fruits; like figs, prunes, and raisins; mixes with the sweet malt, chewy belgian yeast, and some damp earth. The alcohol creeps in as it comes to room temperature. <br/><br/>T - Starts off with a sweet mix of dark fruits and candied sugar slowly giving way a mix of bready malts, spicy belgian yeast, caramel, toffee, molasses, and some chocolatey sweetness. The alcohol begins to rear its head as the ale comes to room temperature, drying the pallet. The finish is a mix of sugary sweetness and light heat from the alcohol. Amazingly balanced overall. <br/><br/>M - Medium-Heavy body and flavor with moderate carbonation. So damn smooth with a little bit of chewiness. The alcohol does become a bit tiresome over the course of the glass.<br/><br/>O - This is still one of my favorite beers of all time. From the dark, complex, flavors to the soft, velvety, feel you would be hard pressed to find a better quad.

Poured from a bottle into a Chimay glass (its the only Trappist glass that I own). Beer was brown, mostly clear until the mud at the bottom of the glass came out, this was avoidable, i know how to pour. The head was diffuse but present and the carbonation was slow but steady, continuously replenishing the thin head. The smell was amazing. Beautiful yeasty and sweet smell. The taste and mouthfeel were out of this world. It was smooth, I could have drank the whole thing in a few minutes but I savored it for as long as possible. Taste was sweet and pleasant.

Moderate amounts of lacing are observed.<br/><br/>S: There is a fair amount of sweetness to the aroma of this beer - caramel, molasses, candi sugar, and dark fruits (cherries, plum, date, and fig). Very light aromas of booze.<br/><br/>T: Upfront there are flavors of dark fruits with cherries dominating and more moderate amounts of plum, fig, and date. There is a decent amount of sweetness but never enough to become cloying - caramel, molasses, candi sugar, and toffee are all present. Moderate flavors of Belgian yeast and just a touch of spices. Light hint of cocoa powder in the finish.<br/><br/>M: Just shy of full bodied with moderate amounts of carbonation. Slightly creamy with a light amount of alcohol warming in the finish.<br/><br/>O: Great complexity to the aromas and flavors make this a world class beer. It is easy to drink and enjoyable, I would gladly have another one of these in the sitting.

The usual suspects were in attendance for a tasting at my place so why not start it off right with a Westy 12.<br/><br/>Poured from a bottle (just shy of a year old) into a small Westy goblet at cellar temperature. This brew appears a clear amber color with ruby and orange tints around the edges of the glass. A cap of fizzy yellowish tan head forms a finger's worth of head that dissolves to a thin lacing across the top of the brew. A light swirl revives the head and produces some spotty lacework on the glass.<br/><br/>The smell of this brew is sweet with dark fruitiness riddled with candy sugar. It smells of plums, raisins, dates and brown sugar. Just collectively a bunch of deep sweet scents whack the nose. A light touch of fruity alcohol is present and a contrasting strong herbal to almost medicinal hoppy bitterness keeps the sweetness of this brew's smell in check.<br/><br/>The taste of this brew is sweet caramelized sugars tasting reminiscent of plums and raisins. There is a light nuttiness to the malt flavoring and a strong booze flavor that is backed by herbal flavors and modest hoppy bitterness. This initially tasted like the sweetness could get out of control but the alcohol and hoppy bitterness keep it balanced. There is a lingering taste of candy left in the mouth coupled with fusel alcohol and a bit of yeastiness that provides a light spiced aspect like clove.<br/><br/>This is a medium bodied brew that has a lively, prickly level of carbonation. A little young, green yeastiness is present throughout the flavor profile. This is more herbal and bitter than I was expecting with hops being more evident than I would prefer but regardless it is balanced well and enjoyable. I couldn't wait any longer to open this brew and finally give it a try. Unfortunately it did not live up to my expectations, shame on me for opening this too early. Perhaps I will need to acquire a vintage bottle and revisit my review.<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">1,957 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/stakem.300923/">stakem</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/313/1545/?ba=stakem">Apr 27, 2011</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="168653" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/huhzubendah.168653/"><img alt="Photo of Huhzubendah" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/168/168653.jpg?1330063255" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">5</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#006600;">+8.5%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5</span><br/><br/>A huge thanks to Brad for sharing several of these with me over the last few years.<br/><br/>Westvleteren 12 pours a somewhat thin looking brown hue with a nice sized head and decent lacing. Ooo...there's some abbey floaties in my glass...straight from God. Amen. Sweet malt with raisins, figs, and seductive Belgian yeast fill the senses throughout the smell and taste. What deliciousness! The beer is a bit thin in the feel, but on a positive note, this makes it silky smooth and easy to drink. The aftertaste is great and lingers for a considerable time between sips. This is remarkable beer.<br/><br/>Edit: July 21, 2012<br/><br/>Split a 2005 vintage with Brad. Rain water, earth, malt, yeast. Sublime.

The baked apples are the dominant flavor followed by caramel and sugar. The dark fruits come in the finish. Don't get me wrong.

I attended their wedding a couple of years ago and they received some bottles as a wedding present and held them for one of my visits. My Facebook page shows us drinking this beer on a hot, humid night as took the best notes possible.<br/><br/>I was (hopefully) getting smarter as I went along. I only gently poured a little better than half of the bottle after it foamed continually once the cap was popped. Its color was a deep brown with good clarity, excepting a slight sludge in the well of the glass. Nose was really rich with a good bit of alcohol heat accompanying notes of fudge, anise and licorice. The mouthfeel was REALLY hot, medium-to-full, and filled my mouth with caramel, burnt brown sugar and molasses. It was MUCH sweetr than any of us expected. Finish had a sugary, malty heat that seemed to linger, killing the other underlying flavors. I also poured the lees separately, and they turned out to be comparable to the taste of the beer initially without the heat, perhaps even a bit sweeter.<br/><br/>I am not discounting how good this beer was, especially in the face of so many horrible CANQuest (TM) beers, but neither did I hear the singing of angels or have any sort of religious experience.<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">1,341 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/woodychandler.5708/">woodychandler</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/313/1545/?ba=woodychandler">Dec 18, 2010</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="1881" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/gavage.1881/"><img alt="Photo of Gavage" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/1/1881.jpg?1329938233" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.55</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#990000;">-1.3%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4</span><br/><br/>Pulled out my new Maudite glass and poured it.

Worth every penny, and I will need to return to the only place I have seen it in NJ and buy some more. Lasting impression that I termed "great Belgian on steroids" to my wife.

A fresh one here, bottle cap dated 22.09.13. Poured into an official Westvleteren chalice. Smoke and big gas pop upon opening. <br/><br/>A great appearance consisting of a creamy off tan/white head that has peaks and valleys. Whipped up meringue like topping. Body is a nice dark ruby red and some chestnut/walnut dark brown with a see through quality but dark to actually see through. Lacing while drinking is exceptional consisting of scatters waves of foam while drinking. Once again like their blonde, an amazing appearance.<br/><br/>Nose though is almost non existent. Closed and muted a subtle hint of alcohol heat over top a juicy grape. Nose opens up after a couple of sips more so slightly. Hints of grainy ripping husk sense too after opening, perhaps some raisin/dates sense.<br/><br/>Taste though, is an example I think of why lots of people cellar this beer. A very noticeable and overpowering hot alcohol heat that sits on top of a juicy grape palate. Alcohol masks much of the malt and fruit component but does bring interesting play. Much of the boozy feels like a junipery gin with classic botanicals and so forth. Texture is solid even creamy to some extent giving that juicy feeling. There is a tannic quality to this like the 8 but more like a nut than barrel/wood with a teeth coating chew.<br/><br/>Overall man I wish this wasn't so hot. It feels like a typical hot young wine that needs to age maybe that will make it better? Would love to age this and try it again some day in the future.<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">1,536 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/smakawhat.204323/">smakawhat</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/313/1545/?ba=smakawhat">Sep 16, 2011</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="2737" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/gueuzedude.2737/"><img alt="Photo of Gueuzedude" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/2/2737.jpg?1330016179" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.85</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#006600;">+5.2%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5</span><br/><br/>Sampled February, 2004; Hop Leaf, Chicago<br/>Total 4.8<br/>An immediate rich, bready aroma wafts from my glass as I pour this beer. This beer is topped by a light brown head that sits atop a brown beer. There are notes of sherry, plum, and raisin (though the raisin is definitely the most dominant aroma) in the nose. The beer smells sweet &amp; rich as well. Well the taste is fairly rich &amp; sweet; there is lots of fig and plum notes, which are joined by a woodiness that is in the taste as well. This beer was an awesome way to finish my great dinner at the Hop Leaf. There is an astringent complexity to this beer that just brings it to a whole other level, and there is a slightly musty character that integrates well with the rest of the flavors. I can fully understand why many consider this a world class beer. I really like how this beer is quite fruity in both the aroma and in the taste. The alcohol is very well hidden here, I can't really detect it at all. The rich sweetness is very conducive to being an after dinner drink. This beer is like a rich, dark, sweet traditional German bread. What makes this beer so good is that it is extremely well integrated; absolutely world class.<br/><br/>Cap Best By Date November 2007; Sampled February 2009<br/>Total 4.1<br/>4/4/4/5/4<br/>A vigorous pour into my large Tripel Karmeliet tulip produces a two-finger thick, creamy, tan colored head. The beer is a dark, concentrated amber color that when held up to the light shows that I poured quite a bit of the sediment from the bottom of the bottle into my glass, but is also a hazy, bright cherry color. The aroma smells of spices and fruit with a rich, caramelized maltiness to the finish. Aromas of fig cake, brandy soaked fruit cake, some marzipan, clove, dried cherries, white pepper, candied ginger form the bright aromatic notes. There is a nice backbone here of must and damp earth, as well as some toasted malt character that provides a biscuit malt aromatics. Some higher alcohols provide a bit of spiciness as well as some warming character to the tail end of each draught of the nose. This has quite a rich nose to it, both the fruit and spices accentuate the perceived sweetness of the aroma.<br/><br/>Up front this beer is a bit lighter than I expected, as it rolls across my tongue though it starts to pick up a viscous richness and heft, though it still maintains the drinkability that I like to have in a strong Belgian ale. The beer has a definite sweetness (though not as much as the aroma might have suggested), but finishes with a spiciness that helps to dry the palate out. The beer is a bit carbonated still after the vigorous pour and it provides a prickly carbonation as it rolls across the tongue. fruit notes of prunes, musty figs and raisin are brought out by a touch of tartness as well as the sweetness in this beer. There is a definite mustiness to this beer, it is oxidation character that it has picked up over the years, and it mixes nicely with the spiciness in the finish. Speaking of which, the spiciness provides notes similar to white pepper, clove, a nutmeg like bite, some woody ginger and a touch of menthol in the long finish as well as some bitter cocoa. This definitely gets more complex as it warms up from the high 40°F (~8°C) that it started out at. The alcohol in the finish combines with the fruitiness to reminds me of Brandy.<br/><br/>Well I had a bug dive bomb this beer, so it must have though there was something worth drinking in my glass (one of my dogs got a tasty, Westy soaked morsel because of that). While this beer is quite good, I am quite disappointed in some ways. I haven't had this in a couple years, and I am thinking I need to try a fresher version to see if it is more like my memory of having this in Belgium and at the Hop Leaf (where I had it last).<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">3,782 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/gueuzedude.2737/">Gueuzedude</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/313/1545/?ba=Gueuzedude">Feb 09, 2004</a></span></div></div></div></div></div>
