Thick chunks of lace randomly line the glass on the drink down. Smell is incredible with lots of tropical fruit, peach, apricot, mango, and some citrus zest. Taste is of sweet malt, tropical fruit, peach/apricot, and mango. There is a slightly assertive citrus zest hop bitterness that lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a light crispness and a smooth mouthfeel. Overall, this is a fantastic DIPA with the wonderful tropical fruit aromas and flavors I have come to love in hoppy beers. I am very glad I got to try this one as I had absolutely no luck getting a bottle myself.<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">861 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/uclabrewn84.439438/">UCLABrewN84</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/14064/56082/?ba=UCLABrewN84">Dec 13, 2011</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="288024" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/grg1313.288024/"><img alt="Photo of GRG1313" border="0" height="48" src="styles/default/xenforo/avatars/avatar_male_s.png" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.89</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#006600;">+7.2%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5</span><br/><br/>Pours a crystal clear amber with a nice white head (historically when only on tap it was cloudy orange with some particulates; clarity is as a result, I'm told in a change in brewing procedures for bottling). <br/><br/>Nose is as good as it gets. Huge assertive sweet fresh pineapple. <br/><br/>Mouthfeel is rich and creamy and very inviting. The balance is wonderful.<br/><br/>Flavors are just about perfect. Front palate is rich fresh honey that developes to green pepper, celery, salt, green herbs and finishes with a big grapefruit skin oil bitter character. <br/><br/>This beer deserves the hype and, for me, is the best Double IPA on the market, in my opinion, an opinion held since I first tasted it at the brewery and brought home several growlers.<br/><br/>(Truthfully, years past on tap only have been slightly better only because they have been a bit all around "brighter" which I like.) However, this new bottling is quite good and deserves the hype. <br/><br/>Drink fast - this is not one to hold.<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">962 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/grg1313.288024/">GRG1313</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/14064/56082/?ba=GRG1313">Aug 26, 2011</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="243272" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/thorpe429.243272/"><img alt="Photo of Thorpe429" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/243/243272.jpg?1330444250" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.69</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#006600;">+2.9%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5</span><br/><br/>Huge, huge thanks to Solomon420 for getting me out a "growler" of this.<br/><br/>A: Pours a beautiful slightly-hazed apricot color with a very nice <br/>white head and plenty of lacing.<br/><br/>S: Incredible. Absolutely floored by the fruit presence here. Immense aroma of peach, apricot, and a bit of mango. Other tropical fruits as well. At this point, the Citra hops can do no wrong.<br/><br/>T: Not quite as good as the nose, but still extremely delicious. The fruit just pops; there is some bitterness in the background, but not really too much. Similarly, no real malt presence. This is just pure hop flavor and aroma.<br/><br/>M: Medium body with good carbonation and quite smooth.<br/><br/>D: Immensely drinkable, especially for the style. The 8.0%abv does not come through at all. It's simply plenty of delicious hop flavor with a slightly bitter edge to it. While this might not be nearly as bitter as other West Coast beers of the same style, the flavor is just unbeatable; I don't care what the style is.<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">973 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/thorpe429.243272/">Thorpe429</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/14064/56082/?ba=Thorpe429">Jun 02, 2010</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="408506" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/knapp85.408506/"><img alt="Photo of Knapp85" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/408/408506.jpg?1330115077" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.54</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#990000;">-0.4%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75</span><br/><br/>Big thanks to DaveHack for pouring one of these for me. This beer poured out darker than I expected. It has a golden amber color with a nice foamy white head on top. The lacing and retention were very nice. The smell of the beer is very nice, big amounts of peach and pineapple aromas on this brew. Smells very fruity and sweet, very inviting. The taste of the beer has some subtle lemon flavors with other hoppy citrus notes and a balanced malt backbone. The mouthfeel is smooth, very creamy feel to it along with some light carbonation. Overall this is very good, I would drink lots of this beer. Very pleased with how this beer was.

Thanks!<br/><br/>Orange-amber body, hazy and nearly opaque, topped by two fingers of dense frothy foam that slowly settles to a small but lasting cap.<br/><br/>The aroma is unadulterated citrus fruit: lemon zest, orange peel, pineapple. There's also a touch of resiny pine and peach. There's no malt to speak of, but the hop aroma is massive and wonderful. As it warms I pick up more tropical fruit.<br/><br/>The hops are similarly huge on the palate, dominated by lemon, orange and tangerine citrus flavors. There's little malt to speak of, it's dry and crackery, barely providing a foundation for the big hop character. Tropical fruit in the finish with a clean but lingering resiny bitterness.

Review transcribed from notes.<br/><br/>Poured into a tasting glass, it had a peachy orange tone and a fluffy cap of lasting foam. Pleasantly hazed and unfiltered. Drippy arcs of lacing form inside the glass as its sipped. Good retention, with a lasting skim across the surface. <br/><br/>Complex ultra-fruity citrus aroma, orange, grapefruit, and more... mangoes even?! Dank and resiny, i'm really digging the Citra on showcase in here. <br/><br/>Hands down the most exact resemblance to grapefruit juice i've ever experienced in a beer. Almost identical to a glass of fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice. Wow. Pure unadulterated grapefruit citrus bomb. Subtle hop bitterness comes across too, leafy and green. Soft supple feel, light even carb, not quite approaching syrupy. This stuff was awesome. Thanks Alex for turning me on to Kern River... this gives Pliny a run for it's money, no doubt.<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">939 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/emerge077.17949/">emerge077</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/14064/56082/?ba=emerge077">Apr 28, 2010</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="104485" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/mikesgroove.104485/"><img alt="Photo of mikesgroove" border="0" height="48" src="styles/default/xenforo/avatars/avatar_s.png" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.92</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#006600;">+7.9%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5</span><br/><br/>Huge thanks to chswimmer for sending this one my way. I knew i had to get ahold of it and quick as word was out, this was one killer dipa. Served cold and enjoyed the whole damn thin last night on 04/10/10.<br/><br/>The pour was superb. So damn cloudy and thick looking, the consistency of very pulpy grapefruit juice but with a more amber tone to it. Big head of white rises up but fades after a few minutes coating the entire glass with sticky white webbing that never does fade away, this is going to be a beast. Each whiff of the aroma is like heaven. I swear I did not think somethin could smell this ripe in fresh, it was divine. Rich and sweet oranges, hints of mango and passion fruit. Soo fresh it was absurd. I have never smelled anything like this before. It was just perfect. Even warming just seemed to bring it out more, rich decadent citrus aromas packed with a candy like sweetness that had me in tears literally, super soft and delicate flavor just really had me on the ground. I cold not have envisioned this coming across any fuller or better, it was just unreal. Orange slices just grip the palate and refuse to let go as the deep and fresh resin like flavor. Each sip was like gold, smooth, mellow and suprisingly well balanced, I am in awe of this beer. Each sip was better then the one before. Manoes and ripe grapefruit now coming through, papaya and star fruit, just everything that you could imagine as being sweet, citrusy and fresh was thrown in here without regard. This is what I want, every day, all day. 8 perfect my ass as you drink it like water. Three pints down in an hour as I sit on the deck and relax. Never had I had a big beer be soo drinkable.<br/><br/>Overall I am speechless. This is what it is all about. Do not stop, go get this, I am at a loss.<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">1,775 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/mikesgroove.104485/">mikesgroove</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/14064/56082/?ba=mikesgroove">Apr 12, 2010</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="276274" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/wethorseblanket.276274/"><img alt="Photo of wethorseblanket" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/276/276274.jpg?1330554995" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.6</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#006600;">+0.9%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5</span><br/><br/>A: Pours a hazy golden orange with a firm half-inch white head which fades slowly to the rim leaving stringers and splotches of lace.<br/><br/>N: Floral grapefruit blossoms, mango, tangerine, perhaps passionfruit, an orange.

Thanks go to Deuane for hooking us up with this growler of hoppy goodness from CA. <br/><br/>Pours a slightly hazed copper, with a finger of rich bright-white head. Very nice looking full flare-up on this, which drenches the sides of the glass with heavy lacing. The aroma has a big hoppy bouquet on it, full of floral hops, spice, pine cones, a bit of herbal dankness, and a ton of DEEP tropical fruit character. There is some stiff toasted graininess behind all of those hops but most of the sweetness here is mostly coming from all of that juicy citrus character. <br/><br/>Those same hops blast off in the taste, being rich with spice, lighter resins, and citrus. A combo of tropical sweetness (mango &amp; pineapple) and more bitter offerings (grapefruit) really gives the profile a biting and tangy fruitiness. The malt backbone gives comes off as more of a toasted grainy presence, offering up some balance but not necessarily a whole lot of sweetness. Just enough to really let those hops come to the forefront and shine. Very bitter and gritty finish on this, with spice and grapefruit especially lingering hard on the tongue. The mouthfeel is medium to fuller bodied, large and sharp feeling creaminess to this that fills the palate up with flavor. There is some gentle warmth to the body but that 8% ABV is really fantastically hidden here. <br/><br/>You know, this was a VERY good DIPA, just dripping with hop flavor and possessing a ridiculously drinkable body for the size of it. This just lacked a certain bright feeling "pop" to the flavors that I could tell should have been there but had probably diminished some after a cross country journey. I could believe that this on draft or in a freshly filled growler would definitely get this up into World Class status.

I've been drooling over this for quite some time, and now I finally get a shot thanks to the awesome trader Solomon420.<br/><br/>A: Still got some nice carbonation, as the head rises up to about a finger and a half on a beautiful pour. THe head fades somewhat slowly, like it's teasing me as a pillow, which happens to be what it looks like, all pillowy there in it's glass. It also leaves a decent lacing on the sides as the pillow dissolves. The beer is a super hazy orange nectar color.<br/><br/>N: I could smell it on the pour, as expected. The aroma is loaded with hops, as expected. Lots of fresh hops, both dry and wet it seems, like they couldn't figure out how awesome this beer should be, so they threw both in. It has lots of musty fresh wet hops, a little resin, lots of pine, the citrus just dances around with more orange peel and even a little grapefruit, as well as even some spicy hops. The musty fresh resinous wet hops really overpower most of it. Oh yeah, and I get a hint of sweet malts there too.<br/><br/>T: Aaaannndddd... ooh yeah, the fresh hops dance around the palate, again loaded with fresh musty and somewhat resinous wet hops. Pretty spicy in the hop profile as well, with lots of pine and citrus hops. Again with the orange peel and light grapefruit, and some tropical flavors. Most of this is overpowered by the resinous musty hops though. Some chewy malts are present, but barely. They add a touch of sweetness and some nice body. THe slightest touch of a booze taste also there. It's pretty bitter overall, but not overwhelming. Some juiciness to the flavor as well, give it a drinkable somewhat refreshing taste.<br/><br/>M: Medium to slightly heavier body, a nice firm body, with still decent carbonation. A little oily as well from the hop oils.<br/><br/>F: Finishes even more bitter, but still not menacingly cringing bitterness. The lingering hop flavors include spicy hops, some musty hop profile but much less than before, a little citrus and pine, with a little fresh hop oils that seem to coat the tongue even. Mostly dry at this point, but a touch of sweetness there. It doesn't overpower with dryness either, which I was expecting the bitterness and dryness to just bombard each other, but low and behold they didn't. All that and the alcohol is practically not there. I think I get a very slight hint as it warms, but overall for 8% drinks really well.<br/><br/>So, an amazing DIPA as expected. It doesn't have the best hop flavors IMHO, a little too much on the musty resinous flavors and less on the pine and citrus, but a great tasting beer. But with what is lacking in hop flavors, it more than makes up for in balance and core design. The hops and light malty sweetness balance really well, nothing outsteps its bounds (except the musty resinous hop flavor just a bit), the dryness and bitterness don't overpower together, a nice juicy fruity flavors, just so drinkable and delicious. Due to the fresh wet hops and oils, resin, etc, this really has to be drunk fresh as expected and as always stated.

This was one attractive beer: cloudy apricot-orange color with an inch or so of thick, foamy, white head that retained strongly, coating the glass with lacing. Nice aroma of citrus zest and underripe pineapple, for a fresh bottle, it wasn't really exploding with aroma as I had hoped, but it was still nice. The taste was good, nothing mind-blowing, pretty much average on the scale of IPAs or DIPAs. Good burst of hops, more bitter than fresh and juicy, citrus rind, underripe pineapple, herbal notes, grassy notes, bready malt base. Good, but nothing special or unique really. Smooth mouthfeel for a double, with just about no alcohol burn at all, though a little graininess lingered in the aftertaste. With all the hype this beer gets, I really expected something different, but it was really just a basic IPA, and offered nothing more than a typical local option. Still good, of course, just wackily overrated.<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">1,004 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/rifugium.304205/">Rifugium</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/14064/56082/?ba=Rifugium">Nov 18, 2013</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="414386" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/mdfb79.414386/"><img alt="Photo of mdfb79" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/414/414386.jpg?1329962957" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.59</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#006600;">+0.7%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5</span><br/><br/>Received a bottle of this today from Whatsarezaf; thanks Reza!

Near perfect nose for a DIPA, I love it.<br/><br/>t - Tastes of citra hops, tropical fruits, mangos, peaches, floral hops, fruity malts, grapefruit, lemon, light pine hops. Taste is great as well. A little bit maltier then the nose though still a ton of hops too. Great taste, the nose was just perfect.<br/><br/>m - Medium body and moderate carbonation. Some light bitterness but not much considering how hoppy it is. Very nice body.<br/><br/>o - Overall I thought this was an amazing DIPA; probably the best Citra DIPA I've had. The nose is perfect, and the taste is great too. Tons and tons of citra hops and tropical fruits, and not much bitterness in the taste at all.

Shared with the Chicago crowd, served in a Hopleaf tulip glass.<br/><br/>A - Pours with two-plus fingers of off-white foam that slowly dissipates to a chunky cap and leaves plenty of splotchy lacing. The body is a hazy, nearly opaque, golden peach color - I can just barely see my fingers through the glass. If the body glowed a bit more this would have been perfect.<br/><br/>S - Smells like a ton of hops! Is this really a single-hop DIPA, because it smells like there are bunch of things in here? Lots of fresh oranges, citrus rinds, notes of pine and dank earthiness, maybe a touch of chive in the periphery. The malt bill adds only the slightest bit of sugary support. When it's warm there's the slightest hint of alcohol.<br/><br/>T - The taste is nearly as good, with lots of juicy sugary citrus. It's still incredibly hop-forward but some of the complexity and depth has been smoothed out. Still, it's hands down quite delicious. The bitterness is surprisingly well-attenuated for the style - it's like that guy who makes a brief appearance at the party, but then cuts out long before it ends. I could actually have stood for a little more fierceness in this area. It's not quite at 4.5 level for me, but I bumped up some other areas a notch to compensate for the lower score here.<br/><br/>M - Nice enamel coating resins. Medium-thick body with more than a sufficient amount of heftiness. Low, softer carbonation, and a light dry finish. Very good, but not game-changing.<br/><br/>D - Once I opened this, I immediately regretted sharing it - I probably could have had it on my own (and then been falling-down drunk). This is up there with the most excellent Breakwater Maverick's for best DIPA of 2010, and was a little better than the fresh Dreadnaught we opened immediately afterward.

Growler poured into a taster glass.<br/><br/>A - Pours deep amber orange with a small half finger tall white head, dissipating down to almost nothing, leaving light lacing down the glass.<br/><br/>S - HUGE citric hop punch up front that never really fades from the limelight. Some caramel malt and tropical fruits offer as much balance as they can but it is really all about the hops.<br/><br/>T - Still plenty of citric hops up front; just not as much as the nose; giving way slowly to a mix of light caramel malt and fresh tropical fruits. Finish is quite bitter but it doesn't last for very long. I really like this one. It is not too over the top like others, it is quite refreshing actually. Glad I finally got to try it.<br/><br/>M - Medium body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Nice crisp feel with a good amount of lingering hop bitterness in the finish.<br/><br/>D - Dangerously high. I finally get to try this one on for size. I really enjoyed the Hill Farmstead Citra but I think the Kern River was a bit more well rounded.

Thanks. Beer is yellow and light in color but completely hazy. Carbonation is moderate which is good since its a growler. There is a lot of lacing on the glass from the white head of small to medium bubbles. Looks nice.<br/><br/>From the first moment I started pouring this beer, the aroma knocked me down. Seriously, it is one of the best smelling beers I have ever smelled. Complex fruit salad of peaches and pineapple and mango. Its the citra hops that give it such a floral and complex aroma, I'm now thinking about making a line of air fresheners that use citra hops. Amazing.<br/><br/>Like most west coast IPAs this is not a malt bomb. It is relatively light on the tongue, lots of carbonation stimulates the midpalate and focuses your attention on the fruitish flavors of this beer. It doesn't start out too bitter but it gets you there pretty quickly. Bitterness definitely grows over the course of the beer, no aftertaste though, just lingers. Drinkability is high, not as high as a few other DIPAs but its up there. Its a great example and experiment in the potential hops have on the overall character of a beer. I would recommend this in a heartbeat and would definitely have it again.<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">1,239 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/drabmuh.4791/">drabmuh</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/14064/56082/?ba=drabmuh">Apr 19, 2010</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="442890" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/mdaschaf.442890/"><img alt="Photo of mdaschaf" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/442/442890.jpg?1329927094" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.89</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#006600;">+7.2%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5</span><br/><br/>Review from notes. Big thanks to Shane for sharing this bottle with me!<br/><br/>A: Pours a slightly hazy golden color with one finger of white head on top. Has nice retention and leaves behind some nice lacing. <br/><br/>S: Tons of citrus and tropical fruits. Tons of pineapple, mango, and orange. There is a little bit of caramel malt, but very faint. Not much pine or malt, just straight juicy fruit. Extremely fresh and inviting. <br/><br/>T: Similar to the aroma in that there is a tropical fruit explosion right away. Lots of citrus, pineapple, mango, tangerine, orange, and some grass. There is a bitterness in the middle that I felt in my jaw, but it has a very smooth finish with very little lingering bitterness. <br/><br/>M: Medium bodied with medium carbonation. Drinks very smooth with a slightly dry finish, but not overly bitter at all. <br/><br/>O: Incredibly drinkable, there is no sign of the 8% abv whatsoever. The flavors are intense and amazing, and it doesn't have the bitterness that most West Coast DIPAs do. One of the best beers I have had period.<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">1,033 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/mdaschaf.442890/">mdaschaf</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/14064/56082/?ba=mdaschaf">Sep 29, 2011</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="144305" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/mothman.144305/"><img alt="Photo of mothman" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/144/144305.jpg?1330989119" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.79</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#006600;">+5%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5</span><br/><br/>BIG Thanks to dgb3 for sending this out!! Dan, you are the man!!!<br/><br/>Poured into Weyerbacher tulip.<br/><br/>Pours about a finger of off-white head. Fades to a thick ring, but leaves a ton of sticky lace walls. I am talking about lacing all the way with each sip I take. Color is a hazy burnt copper orange. Fairly dark for the style.<br/><br/>Aroma: Holy sweet fruits!!! Tons of fruit flavors with this dipa. Mangoes, pineapples, grapefruit citrus, and oranges. This is a massive fruit and citrus blast. Pure awesomeness. The fruit is backed up with a big malt backbone which is actually pleasant with this beer. Has a nice pine hop profile to it. I am diggin' this a lot. I really don't think it gets any better than this.<br/><br/>Taste: Again, a massive amount of fruit flavors. Mangoes stick out a lot with grapefruit, pineapple, and orange backing it up. Lots of pine hops, but some floral hops seem to show through a bit. The malts are definitely here, but in a good way. The malts add a level of sweetness to this beer. They seem to be of caramel/bready flavored and really work perfectly with this beer. I am having a hard time finding anything wrong with this one. <br/><br/>Mouthfeel: Creamy, chewy, and hardly bitter at all. Medium to full bodied for the style with a perfect amount of carbonation. The bitterness shows a little more in the aftertaste. The beer ends a little dry with lots of hops and fruit. <br/><br/>Overall... Wow! I am blown away by this beer. This is up there for the best of the best DIPA imo. The level of fruit is amazing. The malts that show are perfect. No booze shows through at all. This beast is very drinkable. I have an entire growler for myself and I have a feeling I will be able to finish it easily tonight. This beer is very drinkable and everything I want in a dipa. So much citrus and fruit flavors. I just can't get over this one. I can see why this beer is all they hype right now. If dipas are your thing, you gotta try this one. One of the best out there.<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">1,967 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/mothman.144305/">mothman</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/14064/56082/?ba=mothman">May 23, 2010</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="500016" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/shanepb.500016/"><img alt="Photo of ShanePB" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/500/500016.jpg?1438285285" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.8</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#006600;">+5.3%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5</span><br/><br/>22 ounce bottle courtesy of smarcoly, I can't thank you enough for this. Split with my buddy Nick for a video review and poured into two globe glasses.<br/><br/>A: Gorgeous bright orange, light copper colored body with a small and dense white head. Retention is good and leaves a thin coating across the surface along with some thick bubbles around the edges. Some patches of lace are left behind, too.<br/><br/>S: Freshly peeled citrus fruits with flesh, oils and all. Orange, lemon, pink grapefruit and mango are evident up front. It's literally bursting with amazing hop notes that are all citrusy in nature. It doesn't smell like a bitter hop bomb, either - very balanced and juicy.<br/><br/>T: This is just phenomenal. As with the nose, this is all about the citrus fruits. Orange peels start things off, followed by hints of mango and lemon. The finish and into the linger is nothing but wonderfully juicy pink grapefruit. Fleshy in the finish and very oily and somewhat sticky in the linger. Amazing.<br/><br/>M: Medium-bodied, very balanced carbonation, not over the top yet not understated. Fairly creamy and sticky, finishes perhaps a touch dry but the citrus fruits even this out quickly.<br/><br/>This is, hands down, my favorite beer that falls under any part of the IPA family. It's so well balanced with the hops and bitterness that you're able to enjoy these qualities at the, essentially, perfect proportions. Citrusy, juicy, hoppy, bitter and insanely crafted. It doesn't get much better than this, folks.<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">1,483 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/shanepb.500016/">ShanePB</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/14064/56082/?ba=ShanePB">Sep 06, 2011</a></span></div></div></div><div ba-user="300923" class="user-comment" id="rating_fullview_container"><div id="rating_fullview_user"><div style="padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;"><a class="username" href="/community/members/stakem.300923/"><img alt="Photo of stakem" border="0" height="48" src="http://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/300/300923.jpg?1441201923" width="48"/></a></div></div><div id="rating_fullview_content_2"><span class="BAscore_norm">4.53</span><span class="rAvg_norm">/5</span>  rDev <span style="color:#990000;">-0.7%</span><br/><span class="muted">look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5</span><br/><br/>Huge thanks to BdubleEdubleRUN for this thoughtful extra in our most recent trade. You are the man Brett, thanks a ton!<br/><br/>From a bomber into a snifter, this brew appears a gorgeous color of clear orange with a lighter coloring of yellow around the edges. A finger and a half of froth slightly off-white creamy meringue sits atop this brew with awesome powers of retention. As the cap slowly fades, it paints the wall of the glass with a webbing pattern of lace. A light swirl revives a finger of yellowish stained creamy head. Fantastic looking brew here.<br/><br/>The smell of this brew is a fantastic display of fresh hop character. To call this brew just "citra" is an insult. Not only notes of citrus in the nose but lots of tropical aromas emit from the glass smelling minorly like pineapple, pine, orange/lemon zest and a very light amount of catty character. This brew just smells downright juicy with hops. Awesome display of fresh hops in this brew's nose. As it warms up, a light solvent touch of fruited alcohol is noted across the back that tingles the nose.<br/><br/>The taste of this brew is a hop attack of juicy fruited flavored hops. The initial flavoring is that of bitter herbs and rinds, slightly catty with a touch of sulfur mixed with stinky cheese. Once the palate comes accustomed to the hop assault, more fruited flavors of orange rind, pulp, grapefruit, mild pineapple and grass come forward. There is a very faint malt touch in the background which provides an excellent base for the hops to play off of. It hardly provides any sweetness but more of a toasted touch. As the brew warms up, some solvent alcohol comes forward reminding you that this is a DIPA and there is 8% abv hiding underneath the glorious amount of hop character shoved inside this bottle.<br/><br/>This is a medium bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. Absolutely a fantastic take on the style and a real treat to enjoy. Straight across the board this was a real pleasure. Nitpicking here I would have liked to seen just a bit more body on this. For as much flavor and aroma it packed, it seemed just a touch thin and watery but man did it come across as one super drinkable brew. I devastated this bomber fairly quickly and was looking for more.

I love the tropical fruit like hoppiness I got from other Citra hopped beers I've had so I've really been looking forward to this one. Opened up the growler to share with my Fiance as we put up the Christmas tree. <br/><br/>Poured from a growler into my Southern Tier tulip. It poured kind of a murky, pale orange color in the glass. It started out with a big, active, frothy, white head to it and lasted pretty well into drinking it. The head eventually retreated to the edges of the glass, where it left some fantastic, thick lacing on the sides. Pretty much a perfect looking DIPA, I can't think of anything more I could ask of it.<br/><br/>The aroma has the biggest tropical and fruity hop profile to it I've ever encountered. Lots of pineapple, mango, orange and peach really shine through. It has a bit of a tropical punch like flavor coming through. Awesome aroma, I love it.<br/><br/>The taste follows the aroma with lots opf tropical and fruity flavors. more of the peachy, pineapple, orange and mango are present throughout the flavor. Midway I get more of a green, herbal like, fresh hoppiness to it as well. It leans a bit on the sweet side but finishes wit ha slight bitterness. The sweetness really works well for it too and compliments the citra hop nicely. Just a touch of alcohol comes through in the finish. Fantastic tasting beer.<br/><br/>The mouthfeel is medium bodied and carbonation is moderate and a bit sharp. Drinkability for me is excellent. I love tropical fruit like hoppiness in beers and this one shows it off perfectly. This is probably my new favorite hoppy beer. Loved every part of it and I can only hope something similar to this comes to my market soon. I think this might be a new highest scoring beer for me, and it's definitely a new favorite. It was pretty much perfect in all categories for the style and my taste.<br/><br/><span style="color:#CC8A00;">★</span> <span class="muted">1,867 characters</span><br/><br/><div><span class="muted"><a class="username" href="/community/members/billab914.213734/">billab914</a>, <a href="/beer/profile/14064/56082/?ba=billab914">Dec 03, 2010</a></span></div></div></div></div></div>
